=== Nadene entered the room.
[05:04] <Azzie> I certainly would make suse users pay.
[05:04] <Hildegard> triple.
[05:04] <Lai> Azzie: not since being offline
[05:04] <Felicia> it doesn't need to be "in state" either
[05:04] <Lai> Arlie: lol; actually, they arent
[05:04] <Felicia> Azzie++
[05:05] <Lai> i wonder if mom has a paypal
=== Ricardo entered the room.
=== Julietta left the room (quit: "Leaving").
[05:05] <Ricardo> Is there a way to emulate input for a program listening on a COM port? like send the input in such a way that the program thinks it's getting it from the COM?
[05:05] <Arlie> its a federal reserve european banker tax man judge landlord conspiracy !
[05:05] <Azzie> Lai: I am certainly willing to help and send you what little money I can, but I'm sure A paypal would help a lot more.
[05:05] <Lai> lol
=== Lora left the room (quit: "IceChat - Keeping PC's cool since 2000").
[05:05] <Felicia> yep
[05:05] <Hildegard> Arlie: but it's actually masterminded by the street hotdog salesman
[05:06] <Azzie> lol
=== Mable left the room (quit: Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)).
[05:06] <Felicia> vendor! not salesman ..;lol
[05:06] <Lai> Azzie: i am truly grateful for the effort; but i cant see how i'd get the money out of paypal?
[05:06] <Arlie> Lai, if you ever get a computer and an isp again, by all means, setup a website and start selling vitamins or something ... you have the skills to do it, you just keep thinking you dont need money
[05:06] <Lai> lol remind me of that one
[05:06] <Azzie> Lai: You do need a bank account, but there shouldnt be any reason you couldnt have one?
[05:06] <Arlie> selling vitamins is a worthy profession ... people need vitamins
[05:07] <Lai> Azzie: lol; ask HM why :)
[05:07] <Lai> lol
[05:07] <Angla> Arlie, you are one cold mother
[05:07] <Lai> or search the logs of months past
[05:07] <Arlie> Angla, im not cold, im desensitized
[05:07] <Gigi> Josephina: What's the relationship with cygwin please?
[05:07] <Arlie> if Q has bad credit, it will be hard to get a bank account
[05:07] <Arlie> however, it can be done
[05:08] <Angla> anyways, i've used up all my fast-forward on this mythtv. back later
=== Ronald left the room (quit: ).
=== Adele left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
[05:08] <Azzie> Not a simple checking account, you may have to offer them to keep your debit card though.
[05:08] <Lai> i still think a $15 or $20 debit cards would be a better idear
[05:08] <Delmar> has anyone used pcb ?
[05:08] <Lai> Angla: be well
[05:08] <Arlie> Azzie, yes, even a simple checking account requires that you didnt screw up your last checking account, which is easy to do if you have no money
[05:08] <Lai> or plain money orders
=== Alana left the room.
[05:09] <Lai> or postal orders
=== Les entered the room.

[05:09] <Angelika> hey people, how to say that user:group
[05:09] <Alisa> Kacy: could you change the topic to suggest that all able peoples donate to the Lai Relief Fund?
[05:09] <Lai> i give you the mailing address of where to send them- to the manager of property
[05:09] <Josephina> Gigi: no relationship, they do the same sort of thing, but are different in several ways. I recommend mingw+msys but have used cygwin and got no problem with it
[05:09] <Angelika> that user is anybody???
[05:09] <Ricardo> #offtopic :D
[05:09] <Angelika> or that it dosent have ownership???
[05:09] <Lai> Alisa: roflmao

[05:10] <Lai> Mirta: !!!
[05:10] <Hallie> What's a good way to keep a svn repository that depends on another upstream svn repository?
=== Vashti left the room (quit: Read error: 145 (Connection timed out)).
[05:10] <Lashawna> what are the chances a 16 year old sophomore who's been programming since 10 can a job with google?
[05:10] <Mirta> what's up sir?
[05:10] <Lai> Alisa: heh
[05:11] <Arlie> Lai, get busy designing a website to accept hurricane relief donations and pay yourself a percentage as a salary ... hurricane season is starting again
[05:11] <Lai> Mirta: evicted; need money to escape pennsylvania with all my stuff
=== Virgina left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
[05:11] <Ricardo> Alisa: hehe, what's up? I'm just here trying to figure out how the hell I can try to send commands into a program listening on the parallel com port
[05:11] <Alisa> Lashawna: as a 16 year old Junior also lusting for a job at google, I think you've got better chances than I, at very least.
[05:11] <Mirta> Hey - dude - I like got a job interview tomorrow finally.
[05:11] <Lai> cool
[05:11] <Josephina> Ricardo: I thought com port was serial
[05:11] <Alisa> Ricardo: nothing too important...just celebrating the return of Lai :`)
[05:11] <Lashawna> Mirta, but how old r u
[05:11] <Mirta> 34
[05:11] <Lashawna> Mirta, and do you have a degree?
[05:12] <Arlie> sure, work at google, just dont take stock options in leiu of salary
[05:12] <Lai> heh
[05:12] <Mirta> 2 years.
[05:12] <Azzie> Lashawna: Im a 19 year old coder who has been coding sine at least 10 and am in the same position.
[05:12] <Arlie> at $460 a share for a company that has yet to make $1 in profit ... its not a good deal
[05:12] <Lai> heh
[05:12] <Ricardo> Josephina: you know, I think you're right, but it doesn't matter for what I'm trying to do, but it is serial, I'm just retarded lol
[05:12] <Lai> ok, so where are we on the relif?
=== Sara left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
[05:12] <Azzie> Lashawna: The key with that company is to do get a good degree and do something big in school.
[05:12] <Josephina> Ricardo: hehe ok
[05:12] <Azzie> from what i hear..
[05:12] <Lai> should i post a mialing address to send it to?
[05:13] <Alisa> !seen Kacy
[05:13] <Lai> this would be a one shot thing tho cuz i cant rejoin later to remind
[05:13] <Nicki> Lashawna: Here's a hint. Don't go around telling people you've been programming since 10. (yes, I know it's likely literally true. But it shows immaturity to claim it the same way professional programmers cite their years of experience.))
=== Malcom left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
[05:13] <Josephina> Ricardo: and linux doesn't call it a com port, it's called a serial tty or something
[05:13] <Mirta> Lashawna - who are you and why does it matter so much? People who know me know that this is a step forward.
[05:13] <Lashawna> I'm just tired of working for myself
=== Shayna entered the room.
[05:14] <Alisa> Lai: yeah. Post it. I'll see if we can get Kacy to put it in the /topic :)))
[05:14] <Arlie> Lashawna, no, screw that, if your good, let everyone know it, except your co-workers
[05:14] <Josephina> Ricardo: and how to make a program think it's receiving data from it, would depend on how the program is receiving data from it
[05:14] <Ricardo> Josephina: ah thanks for the heads up
[05:14] <Felicia> Lai: sure . can't hurt .. or open a temp new channel and let everyone interested join .. then take it from there
=== Laraine entered the room.
[05:14] <Ricardo> Josephina: yeah, it's using some library to do it, guess I need to figure out how that library works
[05:14] <Felicia> Lai: open a channel called #Lai ;-)
[05:14] <Lashawna> Arlie, my brother told me that one?
[05:14] <Josephina> Ricardo: ah ok
[05:14] <Lai> ok; but someone else is gonna have to remind others
[05:14] <Felicia> Lai: oh .. whatever then
[05:14] <Azzie> Someone make a quizrelief bot
=== Alice entered the room.
[05:14] <Arlie> Lashawna, co-workers are evil ... they'll screw you up if your good enough to make them look bad .... they operate based on fear
[05:14] <Mirta> hello Azzie
[05:15] <Ricardo> I am half way done with a 4 year degree and working with a company designing software for night vision cameras, co-op programs rock
=== Mable entered the room.
[05:15] <Lai> what whatever?
[05:15] <Lai> huh?
[05:15] <Nicki> Arlie: only at crappy places. :)
[05:15] <Azzie> Ricardo: Hello there, how is it going?
[05:15] <Arlie> Nicki, it happens everywhere
[05:15] <Felicia> Lai: i figured to keep it a bit erm private
[05:15] <Lashawna> Arlie, that's interesting
[05:15] <Nicki> Arlie: cynic. :)
[05:15] <Arlie> Nicki, at least, anywhere were there is a gap in skill levels
[05:15] <Arlie> its human nature
[05:15] <Ricardo> Azzie: pretty good, just at the office, about to leave
[05:15] <Ricardo> how are you?
[05:15] <Lai> Felicia: ok i'm bumming here; fizzle
[05:16] <Felicia> Lai: if everyone needs to mail to that address on their own then maybe it';s beetter you spm it and it get's spammed ;-P
[05:16] <Azzie> Ricardo: Well, end of semester work, what could be better?
=== Angelika left the room ("Konversation terminated!").
[05:16] <Nicki> Arlie: well, I've never been "screwed up" by a junior programmer. they come to me for help.
[05:16] <Josephina> Ricardo: if it's just reading from /dev/ttyS0 or something you could somehow get it to just read from a named pipe instead
[05:16] <Arlie> Nicki, no no no ... someone below you is not a co-worker, they are an underling
[05:16] <Lai> Felicia: ok then what?
[05:16] <Ricardo> Azzie: I hate that crap... you in college?
[05:16] <Lashawna> ok, so my chances with google are probably slim, does anyone know of a company in need of experienced html, css, jscript, perl, python, etc. programmers?
[05:16] <Nicki> Arlie: the sr programmers come to me for help, also. :)
[05:17] <Lashawna> Nicki, then you should get promoted
[05:17] <Ricardo> Josephina: hmm yeah maybe you're right... I might just have to end up modifying the entire program
[05:17] <Arlie> Nicki, yes, but them comming to you, and you making them look bad, are 2 different issues
=== Katherin entered the room.
[05:17] <Felicia> Lai: post the info .. atleast it'll be logged soemwhere then .. i didn't know what/who's address you were going to throw out
=== Izetta left the room (quit: Nick collision from services.).
=== Tena entered the room.
=== Katherin left the room (quit: Excess Flood).
[05:17] <Ricardo> just to read from a different input stream
[05:17] <Azzie> Ricardo: Indeed, trying to decide if im going to keep putting up with this or just start coding for myself.
[05:17] <Tena> hey, anyone know if theres any way i can play songs i bought on itunes in linux?
=== Izetta entered the room.
[05:17] <Azzie> Tena: No, and thats what you get for buying from ITunes.
[05:17] <Ricardo> finish college at least, how many more years you have?
[05:18] <Lai> Felicia: the address to -- you know what, i think it's not such a good idear
[05:18] <Azzie> Ricardo: 3 at least.
[05:18] <Ricardo> Tena: you just need to get the m4a/mp4 plugin
=== Maegan left the room (quit: "I'm leaving.").
[05:18] <Felicia> Lai: see.. ok .. think about it ..
[05:18] <Ricardo> Azzie: you are a freshman this year and already tired of it?
[05:18] <Lai> yea i am
[05:18] <Nicki> Lashawna: I'm paid well. I don't care about job titles. and I enjoy troubleshooting for others. :)
[05:18] <Azzie> Ricardo: I would rather be coding!
=== Dagny entered the room.
[05:18] <Felicia> Lai: or PM one of us .. or whatever ..
[05:18] <Ricardo> Azzie: there is a lot of coding to be done in college lol
[05:18] <Lai> crap
[05:18] <Arlie> Lai, i feel for you, but im not sending you any money
[05:19] <Lai> k
[05:19] <Alisa> Lashawna: look on jobs.com, also jobs.perl.com.
[05:19] <Ricardo> Azzie: get on some open source projects like KDE or gaim or gcc or something
[05:19] <Felicia> so what .. that's just one monkey Q
[05:19] <Azzie> Ricardo: Either that, or transfer to a school where I can find a teacher who is as interested in independent coding projects as I am.
[05:19] <Felicia> there's many more of us apes about
[05:19] <Dorthy> the interesting CS classes don't start until your junior/senior year, especially if you're already familiar with the languages being taught and basic data structure concepts
[05:19] <Arlie> Felicia, hey man, i was homeless and noone sent me any money
=== Horacio entered the room.
[05:20] <Ricardo> Dorthy: true.. I am going into my third year, finally get to do AI and OS and compilers, etc
[05:20] <Azzie> Ricardo: I'm trying, but the problem is that I have to spend far too much time on schoolwork, even though im paying 30k/year for it.
[05:20] <Lai> Arlie: did you ask?
=== Cornelius left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
[05:20] <Arlie> Lai, no
[05:20] <Lai> ok then
[05:20] <Dagny> How can I discover which library file(s) contain an exported function name? I'm having a problem with linking against libpci.a and gzopen, and thinking another library may have declared the names
[05:20] <Azzie> classic
[05:20] <Arlie> Lai, if you have a truck load of stuff, why dont you sell it
[05:20] <Ricardo> Azzie: hehe but it's only 3 more years... that's really short when you think abou tit.. I'd say just bear through it and get your degree, it's going to make it a lot easier to find a job and you'll get paid more
[05:20] <Lai> i dont have access to my stuff atm
[05:20] <Arlie> Lai, then when your out of stuff, find a south bound train and jump on it
[05:21] <Alisa> Azzie: hah, the CS professors at the local university are A.) A man with a degree in parsing, not teaching CS, and B.)A woman who is a MAJOR microserf.
[05:21] <Nicki> Dagny: strings and grep? ;)
[05:21] <Lai> Arlie: yea or bus
[05:21] <Arlie> Lai, wheres all your stuff ?
[05:21] <Lai> Arlie: in the apt i was evicted from
=== Velva entered the room.
=== Na entered the room.
[05:21] <Arlie> Lai, go get it
=== Daphne left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
[05:21] <Dagny> Is that it? With having ldconfig I thought there must be a location for the list of exported functions
[05:21] <Ricardo> Lai: why'd you get evicted? I missed the first half of this conversation
=== Daphne entered the room.
[05:22] <Azzie> Alisa: Luckilly at my school there are no microserfs :-). We all have to do our coding with gcc. The problem is most the profs just teach as a side job so they have their hands more than full.
[05:22] <Ricardo> Josephina: lol I think it'd be much easier if I just modified the program....
[05:22] <Lai> Ricardo: alledged non-payment of rent
[05:22] <Ricardo> so I'm going to do taht
=== Cedrick left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
[05:22] <Nicki> Dagny: or grepping the source code or the documentation of the apis
[05:22] <Arlie> Lai, you mean, payment of rent with junk bonds ?
[05:22] <Lai> Arlie: i wont trespass

[05:23] <Ricardo> alright guys time for me to drive home, bbl
[05:23] <Dagny> Nicki hmmm, i'll see if grep helps, source-code isn't an option for this
=== Ricardo left the room.
[05:24] <Arlie> Lai, and i commend you on the fact that your not like that, but because you live in a world constructed by people who are, you have to play by their rules at least enough to survive
[05:24] <Lai> Felicia:
[05:24] <Felicia> yo yo
[05:24] <Lai> Alisa: seconds really, and i need to do one other thing too
=== Gene left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).

[05:25] <Lai> latter
[05:25] <Nicki> why do you say "alleged" non-payment? did you pay or didn't you? :)

=== Margery left the room (quit: "Konversation terminated!").
[05:25] <Azzie> Thats aweful, bust the door down.
[05:25] <Velva> If i link the two homes folders ie. ff & gg to xx, then I can log in as xx, but how can I choose which link to follow?
[05:25] <Lai> Nicki: i discharged the debt and sent a bond
[05:26] <Felicia> Lai: i mean the address that you can trust us to mail money to
[05:26] <Arlie> Felicia, western union
[05:26] <Arlie> Felicia, he can get it anywhere with a password
[05:26] <Felicia> in C/o ?
