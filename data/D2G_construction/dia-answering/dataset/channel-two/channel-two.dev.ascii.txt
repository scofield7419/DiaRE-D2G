[01:59] <Malcolm> Rachel: If running as root, I need to set up a global config rather than ~/.fetchmailrc ?
[01:59] <Kathie> Jermaine: date '+%m%d%Y'
[01:59] <Rachel> Malcolm: yup
[01:59] <Malcolm> Rachel: I run it in daemon mode under my uid and it works very nicely
[01:59] <Jermaine> I got it.. thanks
[02:00] <Rachel> pretty much put same info in global location.

[02:01] <Elma> 'm sure i missed something but fonts rendering in my gimp works isn't at its best
=== Roselia left the room ("Leaving").
[02:01] <Elma> is it because f the gimp or have i missed some tuning or such?
[02:01] <Sena> is there anyway to see what the CPU temperature is ?
[02:01] <Rachel> Malcolm: use "/etc/fetchmailrc" -f <pathname> | --fetchmailrc <pathname>
[02:01] <Rachel> Specify a non-default name for the ~/.fetchmailrc run control file.
=== Thurman entered the room.
=== Anja left the room (quit: "burp").
[02:01] <Malcolm> Rachel: in the man page http://fetchmail.berlios.de/fetchmail-man.html it doesn't mention any global fetchmailrc file... that is what was confusing me...
[02:02] <Thurman> hi, do you have any recommendations for saving videos from a webcam in GNU/Linux?
[02:02] <Rachel> Malcolm: give yourself a promotion - You decide! ;-)
[02:02] <Malcolm> Rachel: there are a couple of oblique refs to running as root and that's it. And if I try to run it as root, it says "running as root is discouraged" and then exits :)

[02:05] <Jesse> Malcolm: it runs as user fetchmail here, and uses /etc/fetchmailrc

[02:11] <Johnathon> hey wat's up ?
[02:11] <Shenna> Elma: , then why is it that my 2.4 kernel recognises it as hda?

[02:11] <Denny> so if anything is added to that folder
=== Sang left the room (quit: Connection reset by peer).

[02:12] <Latricia> is there a way to tail -f a file and have that output piped to sed to have certain lines colorized?
[02:13] <Malcolm> Rachel / Jesse: should i put the "set daemon" option in /etc/fetchmailrc ? I'm guessing not
=== Val entered the room.
[02:13] <Shenna> even dmesg says "hda:...."
[02:13] <Shenna> why is it so?
[02:13] <Elma> bye folks
[02:13] <Elma> Shenna: heu... not a damn clue, sorry... but why are using a 2.4 kernel?
=== Elma left the room.
[02:14] <Denny> Shenna, what are you trying to do?
[02:14] <Shenna> i am trying toswitch over ti 2.6
[02:14] <Melda> Elma: maybe because 2.6 still is getting root exploits as development goes on whereas 2.4 hasn't had any in a long time?
[02:14] <Tammi> hi, i am trying to dump a file system to a dat SCSI tapedrive. if i dump /var partition the speed is 1555KB/S, but if i dump the /home partition i barley get half that speed. Why would this be?
[02:14] <Denny> Melda, if you stick with around 2.6.12 its all cool
[02:14] <Shenna> but 2.6 gives errors on my laptop

=== Evon left the room (quit: "Ex-Chat").
[02:18] <Shenna> k
[02:18] <Melda> Shenna: check the dev entries? + some things change it... my laptop is definitely hda, my openbsd and 9/10 distributions recognize it that way - but for some reason my slackware sees it as being sda... just weird stuffs
[02:18] <Lizeth> 2.4 limited sata support?
=== Aldo entered the room.
[02:18] <Melda> Shenna: laptops are sort of odd in that way of sata/scsi/etc

[02:35] <Gale> Shenna: there's some security advisory up to version 2.6.20.8 afaik. Guess what, if you use say 2.6.20.1, for instance, and your distro didn't address those vulnerabilities in their older version of the kernel, you're vulnerable.

[02:53] <Paulita> hosting?
[02:53] <Josef> they give more if you sign up as a director

[02:55] <German> Gale, excuse my ignorance, but doesn't gnome have something similar?(never went into the details of it, but gconf looks like the registery)
[02:55] <Margene> yes, it's a bigger hype than usual
[02:55] <Paulita> all i did was make a brief statement and now i am suffering with all this grief :D
[02:55] <Josef> someone else I know put together an email to send them which I helped him with, not sure if he's sent it
[02:55] <Josef> gonna go over the legal side with a fine tooth comb tomorrow probably
[02:55] <Hildegard> Josef: what did you come up with?
[02:55] <Arlie> Paulita, happens to me all the time ;)
[02:56] <Paulita> hi Arlie
[02:56] <Arlie> Paulita, they love killing the messenger
=== Demetrius entered the room.
[02:56] <Gale> German: I don't know all the details of gnome, but those are just text files that gconf uses
[02:56] <Paulita> haha

[02:56] <Josef> Hildegard, they're violating the terms of the license and are therefore illegally selling copyrighted material on ebay. should get the account closed, would be nice to see some refunds but I doubt ebay does that.
[02:56] <German> Gale, my own preference is each program having it's own .(name) directory in $home
[02:56] <Gale> German: more or less the whole gconf gui registry looking thing in gnome is really just a fancy front end for editing them
[02:56] <Gale> afaik
[02:56] <Angla> http://www.grc.com/stm/shootthemessenger.htm
[02:57] <Arlie> Paulita, but having just read the scrollback, you are being somewhat of a snot nosed punk
[02:57] <Paulita> Arlie you want to see my home town? it is on youtube :)
[02:57] <Hildegard> Josef: :D
[02:57] <Paulita> well fine then
[02:57] <Arlie> nope ... dont care at all
[02:57] <Paulita> good
[02:57] <Paulita> cause now i know you too
[02:57] <Hildegard> shutting down a powerseller, awesomeness.
[02:57] <German> Gale, okay but i do have a question here: don't windows ever update their libc? I heard that's what breaks most of the binary compatibility in linux
=== Emeline entered the room.
[02:57] <Arlie> Paulita, im sure it looks exactly like my home town
=== Kathryn left the room (quit: Read error: 113 (No route to host)).
[02:58] <Christiana> Anybody know a good OS for laptop? Has to support wifi - Office programs and firefox, i thought puppy linux or something.
[02:58] <Paulita> there is a major difference between a monkey hole and a bahia brazil ;)
[02:58] <Priscila> Christiana: why bother asking here?
[02:58] <Gale> German: windows has all sorts of problems with it's system libraries all the time
[02:58] <Priscila> Or do you mean distro?
[02:58] <Christiana> yeah a distro

[02:59] <Priscila> Christiana: is it a low spec laptop?
[02:59] <Margene> and I shoot em for sport
[02:59] <German> Gale, I know, I am not here to argue that windows is better, just that there are some nice aspects to it(with horrible consequences, but still)

[03:01] <Christiana> for me it is low spec, im used to powerfull desktops :P
=== Fernando entered the room.
[03:01] <Melda> Christiana: most "low spec" distributions are garnered for 8MB-32MB w/ 200Mhz or less processors
[03:01] <Angla> 128 millibits is quite low
=== Noel entered the room.
=== Lynda entered the room.
[03:02] <Margene> tell it to my octo core with 16gb ram

[03:03] <Nicki> my first computer had 4kB of ram, a trs-80. :)
[03:03] <Arlie> Lynda, php is buggy like that
[03:03] <Christiana> 4kb?
[03:03] <Priscila> Arlie: heh.
[03:03] <Christiana> What OS runs on 4 KB ?
[03:03] <Nicki> basic
[03:03] <Nicki> ;)
=== Josef left the room.
[03:03] <German> Lynda, you must register on freenode
[03:03] <Lynda> Arlie: thanks... darn i got to fix a stupid problem... :(((
[03:03] <Jeanice> win 95 was 8-16 mb ram wasn't it?
[03:03] <Priscila> Lynda: probably means the channel is full.
[03:04] <Christiana> I never used windows 95, it seems to run like crap
[03:04] <Margene> lose 95 was 32mb
[03:04] <Arlie> 4k was the norm for awhile
[03:04] <German> Jeanice, it sure ran on my 16mb, dunno about 8 though
[03:04] <Lynda> goldfish: so i need to wait until some people leave?
[03:04] <Arlie> my atari 400 only had 16k
[03:04] <Christiana> 4Kilobite, what can you do with that??
[03:04] <Arlie> Christiana, microsoft basic on cassette ran in 4k
[03:04] <Jeanice> Christiana: it should be enough for anyone
=== Anneliese entered the room.
[03:04] <Christiana> Play with the BIOS or something?
[03:04] <German> Lynda, you need to register your nick at freenode, then try to join
[03:04] <Margene> I remember lose 98 was pretty fast on 64mb
[03:04] <Arlie> Christiana, what bios ?
[03:04] <Lynda> German: thanks !
[03:05] <Lynda> German: hey how do i recover a lost passworD? :)))
[03:05] <Hildegard> 98 was pretty fast even with 32, come to think of it.
[03:05] <Hildegard> at least until you started adding lots of stuff.
[03:05] <German> Margene, until you actually add some programs like antivirus and firewall...
[03:05] <Jeanice> i never had 98
[03:05] <Christiana> Bios is a blue screen with buttons when i pres F1 when pc boots, it says PASSWORD and BIOS
[03:05] <German> Lynda, no idea
[03:05] <Jeanice> went straight from 95 to *shudder* Me

[03:07] <Margene> I went from 98 crooked.. I mean straight to XP
=== Rosia loves pointing out that saying "screw microsoft ... they suck !" only makes F/OSS look like communism
[03:07] <Gricelda> W MILAN
[03:07] <Christiana> I went from XP to Ubunto to Vista
[03:07] <Renate> Margene, lol... real people used Win NT

[03:08] <Renate> Hildegard, eh? you're here?.... and wow, the red letters on my xchat screen look painful
[03:08] <Gale> no NT is for the noobs that think they're not
[03:08] <Arlie> for real
[03:08] <Angla> jackson browne had a hit with running on NT
[03:08] <Jeanice> that's GNU/communism
[03:08] <Arlie> microsoft is another enron
[03:09] <Arlie> they didnt make a real profit the entire time bill gates was getting rich
[03:09] <Christiana> Microsoft is loaded with cash, Respect.

[03:09] <Arlie> Christiana, thats because the stock they give to employees isnt on the balance sheet
[03:09] <Hildegard> Renate: it's my shoulder, actually.
[03:09] <Renate> those servers are pretty dangerous, eh?
=== Ruthe entered the room.
[03:09] <Renate> Hildegard, lemme guess, a blade rack fell on it?

[03:09] <Hildegard> Renate: no.
[03:10] <Arlie> Christiana, right ;)

[03:10] <Christiana> Headmonkey: I dont eat bananas.
[03:10] <Renate> Ruthe, the fact that there isn't one?
[03:11] <Arlie> Christiana, you should, they have lots of potassium goodness

[03:11] <Renate> eh? dunno then
[03:11] <Ruthe> it was working this morning, suddenly cant find dhcp

[03:11] <Ruthe> dkkr, plugged directly to cable modem
[03:11] <Arlie> Christiana, while watching mythbusters ?
[03:11] <Angla> Ruthe, lack of networking. or maybe unplugged cable. or maybe a host of other reasons
[03:11] <Nicki> in the lan part of it?
[03:11] <Christiana> Headmonkey: No whil watching JENSEN
[03:11] <Ruthe> Nicki, yes
[03:12] <Gale> Ruthe: try resetting your cable modem

=== Dina left the room (quit: "this is just some wasted space").
[03:12] <Arlie> you stare at your speakers ?

[03:12] <Christiana> Rock On!: http://www.myspace.com/thezimmersband Talking bout my ge-neration!
[03:13] <Ruthe> Gale, unplugging the cable from the linux box and plugging it to an xp box works

[03:19] <Leota> Hi all, anyone know how to mount a usb disk?
[03:19] <Ruthe> yeah, its a pain, but it doesnt change the fact that plugging the network cable to the box, ifdown ifup the interface
[03:19] <Leota> my new kernel doesn't have /dev/sh*
=== Katharina entered the room.
[03:19] <Ruthe> and the box wont get an ip address

[03:20] <Lajuana> Priscila: well, I figure that real hackers are above such things, crackers are going to go after things that won't cause permanent mental scarring, and script kiddies feel comfortable and at home there.
=== Augustina left the room (quit: ).

[03:20] <Margene> script kiddies mostly play with weak botnets ddosing forums
[03:20] <Ruthe> also reboot
[03:20] <Angla> is the *other* end of the cable plugged into the computer ?
[03:20] <Ruthe> just to be on the safe side
[03:21] <Gale> how about try that with stop and then start instead
=== Andy entered the room.
=== Gertrud is now known as Gertrud

=== Giselle entered the room.
[03:21] <Ruthe> Angla, yes, the person im talking to has plugged the cable to the computer before
[03:22] <Ruthe> so at least Im sure he knows how to do that much
[03:22] <Angla> is there another cable to try ?
[03:22] <Gale> has he plugged in a power cable before though?
[03:22] <Ruthe> there is, but why would that same cable work on a different box?
=== Albertine is starting to hate his custom kernel
[03:22] <Leota> but i do love kde 3.5.7 :D
[03:23] <Ruthe> Gale, he is reading to me what he sees on the screen, system is on
[03:23] <Angla> Ruthe, trying as many possibilities as possible. it's *bound* to be something simple

=== Andy left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
[03:24] <Leota> Renate: you get custom text colour for kicker, so you can have a black background in kicker with nice white text or whatever colour you want
[03:24] <Renate> oh... meh, guess it's nothing new then
[03:24] <Leota> and lots more... but kicker is the awesome bit
[03:25] <Margene> the kicker is the kicker
=== Justine left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
[03:25] <Angla> Ruthe, if i were you, i'd make a list of possible reasons why. and then systematically try them out. i wouldn't go assuming anything
=== Andrew entered the room.
[03:26] <Jeanice> you need a custom kernel for kde?
[03:26] <Gale> yeah, it's the assumptions that lead to nowhere
[03:26] <Gale> best thing to do is start with the simple and easy to overlook stuff and work your way up
[03:26] <Leota> Jeanice: no the stock kernel is fine
=== Fernando left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
[03:26] <Leota> Jeanice: i just wanted to add stuff like bootsplash, ubuntu's usplash sucks
[03:27] <Margene> I'll just wait for kde 4
[03:27] <Leota> and i wanted initng
=== Fernando entered the room.
[03:27] <Leota> Margene: long wait then...
[03:27] <Margene> till then I'll stick w/ xfce
[03:27] <Angla> the assumption that linux just decided to not work, is the least likely, by far
[03:27] <Renate> KDE4 is vaporware...
[03:27] <Jeanice> Leota: ah i see, sorry, i thought you made a custom kernel for kde. may i recommend gensplash btw
=== Blanche entered the room.
[03:27] <Margene> indeed it is, but 3.5 just doesn't cut it for me
[03:27] <Santo> Margene: why would you go from XFCE to KDE bloatware? Unless KDE4 will not be bloatware any longer...
[03:27] <Margene> Santo, not go, but try it out
=== Christina entered the room.
[03:28] <Santo> ah
=== Sena left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
[03:28] <Gale> Angla: or like I always say, "
[03:28] <Angla> ?
[03:28] <Margene> the only thing is there's a lot of qt apps that are really great
[03:28] <Gale> When it comes to troubleshooting, educated guesses are good, assumptions aren't
[03:28] <Christina> I have a question. I need to know the kernel parameter to use to tell an ubuntu install where the CD media is located at over a PXE server.
[03:28] <Delmar> has anyone used Xcircuit ? is that an app to draw and to test circiuts if theu work ?
=== Cyndy entered the room.

=== Cyndy entered the room.
=== Lizbeth left the room (quit: "Leaving").

[03:29] <Margene> for example, kget is pretty much the only download manager I've tried that forces resuming on anything, while others fail
[03:29] <Leota> Jeanice: i tried gensplash so many times and i just gave up
[03:29] <Jeanice> Leota: what went wrong?
=== Amber left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
[03:30] <Leota> Jeanice: compiling it was the easy bit, messing with the startup scripts was where i got stuck
[03:30] <Gale> yeah, being methodical is a big part
[03:30] <Jeanice> Leota: ah, personally i don't use the progress bars
=== Kenya entered the room.
[03:31] <Renate> I'm not a big fan of kget :-\
[03:31] <Renate> then again, d4x is kinda broken too
=== Alina left the room (quit: "Leaving").
[03:32] <Margene> I've tried them all, kget is the only one that gets it done
=== Blanche left the room (quit: Client Quit).
[03:32] <Leota> Jeanice: well i couldn't get gensplash to compile, i just got errors, and had to install from some deb which completely failed, the error was related to the kernel
[03:32] <Margene> nothing in gtk2 that's for sure
=== Sena entered the room.
=== Gertrud entered the room.
[03:32] <Gertrud> ok i have an ext3 image
[03:32] <Renate> Margene, eh? yea, I haven't found a thing that can compare to flashget/fdm on Windows..
[03:32] <Gertrud> i did not unmount it cleanly
[03:33] <Renate> Gertrud, fsck
[03:33] <Gertrud> is there a way to fsck an image?
[03:33] <Gertrud> it throws an error when i try to fsck the image
[03:33] <Margene> archangle25, flashgot/kget works for me every time
[03:33] <Jeanice> Leota: what distro?
[03:33] <Gertrud> its not a disk turned into an image, its 30gb of /dev/zero turned into an ext3
[03:33] <Angla> downthemall works for me
[03:33] <Renate> Margene, well, I never said it didn't work, I just find it lacking in features
=== Cristi left the room (quit: Connection timed out).

=== Brande left the room (quit: ).
[03:34] <Margene> well I mean in linux at least, that's the only one that works for me when servers have anti-leech mechanisms
=== Britta entered the room.
=== Inez left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
=== Katherine left the room (quit: "g'night").
[03:35] <Renate> Margene, hint, if they don't want you to leech, don't leech
[03:35] <Margene> no, the problem is they don't just stop leeching, they stop resuming
=== Hassan left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
=== Nada left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
[03:35] <Leota> Jeanice: kubuntu
=== Hermila entered the room.
[03:35] <Arlie> posting stuff for download, then placing restrictions on downloading it, is against the communist manifesto of the OSS bowel movement
[03:35] <Margene> I'm sure it's a lot worse to restart a download and suck up even more bandwidth than to resume some multi GB file at 90%
=== Inez entered the room.
[03:36] <Julietta> can pcap inject packets into a open tcp connection ?
=== Felicitas left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
[03:36] <Arlie> pcap injects ethernet packets
[03:36] <Arlie> so yes
[03:36] <Arlie> they can be tcp,udp,ip, whatever
[03:36] <Renate> Margene, wait, if the file is non-resumable how do you resume it? o.O
[03:37] <Jeanice> Leota: http://jeandamiendurand.free.fr/debian/splashutils/ worked fine for me
[03:37] <Margene> Renate, I dunno, it just happens
[03:37] <Renate> magic, zomg! :o.O
[03:37] <Margene> you send it through flashgot to the downloader again, and it automagically resumes
[03:38] <Julietta> Arlie, yeah, but don't tcp connections have state information that prevent direct injection like that ?
[03:38] <Leota> Jeanice: those are the debs i tried, it messed with the entire apt-get install process, it couldn't run the post install process because the ubuntu startup scripts are so different and because the pre-uninstall scripts couldn't also be run the hole thing fell apart
[03:38] <Arlie> Julietta, you can inject garbage if you want
=== Sandy entered the room.
[03:38] <Arlie> Julietta, or you can steal someones connection
=== Clara left the room (quit: No route to host).
=== Ramona entered the room.
[03:39] <Arlie> Julietta, how any 1 particular tcp stack decides to respond to your garabge depends on its implementation
=== Celsa entered the room.
[03:40] <Julietta> i actually neither want to steal the connection nor i want to inject garbage (data that is not getting accepted by a valid implementation)
[03:40] <Elli> Hmm
[03:40] <Celsa> good morning
[03:40] <Gertrud> hey Renate is there some special option to pass fsck to get it to fsck my ext3 image?
[03:40] <Elli> Any idea why 'passwd' would ask for a new password four times?
=== Crista entered the room.
[03:40] <Priscila> Elli: A hacked version.
[03:41] <Melda> is there a way to get ls -l to print full path in each response?
[03:41] <Arlie> Julietta, do whatever you want ... its an ethernet packet
[03:41] <Leota> Jeanice: i had to replace most of the the startup scripts with just echo boo, the problem seemed to be with the kernel not being detected or something
[03:41] <Melda> so it'll show /home/user/filename.jpg at the end of every single line?
[03:41] <Elli> Priscila, yeah that could be a possbility except I just recompiled it from sources, thinking just that
=== Georgeanna entered the room.
[03:41] <Melda> vs just showing filename.jpg?
[03:41] <Elli> And still the same behavious
[03:41] <Priscila> Elli: Hmmm. Weird indeed ..
[03:41] <Julietta> Arlie, well, i can't, to actually inject valid packets i would need to modify the sockets state
[03:41] <Jeanice> Leota: strange... and what errors did you get when you tried to compile?
[03:41] <Priscila> Melda: ls -l /home/user/*
=== Giselle left the room.
[03:41] <Elli> Ya
[03:42] <Priscila> Elli: I assume you can trust where you gott he sources from?
[03:42] <Arlie> Julietta, use libpcap to do whatever you want ... your sending ethernet packets ... send valid tcp or dont ... its up to you
[03:43] <Leota> Jeanice: don't have that info at the moment, this kernel only has the bootsplash patch
[03:43] <Melda> godlfish: anyway to do that recursively? like with ls -alR to show full paths/permissions on every file in a tree?
=== Arlinda left the room ("Coming Back").
=== Arlinda entered the room.
=== Stefani left the room (quit: "Working on heaven's door").
=== Emilio left the room (quit: "Leaving").
=== Anneliese left the room (quit: "Leaving").
[03:43] <Jeanice> Leota: fair enough
[03:43] <Priscila> Melda: use find, find /home/user/ -exec ls -l {} +
[03:43] <Elli> Priscila, yeah
[03:44] <Felicia> Melda: alias it in your ~/.bashrc
[03:44] <Elli> Priscila, it might be a PAM module problem actually, hmm
[03:44] <Priscila> Melda: actually. that will just do the same thing.
[03:44] <Melda> goldfish: my actual application is a cleint chmod'd "/" to this user... so I want to change EVERYTHING owned by this user on the system to "root:root" and then just fix his homedir
[03:44] <Leota> Jeanice: bootsplash seemed to be easier to install, i added the bootsplash patch, then used splas bla bla > bootsplash, then extracted my initrd file using cpio and added bootsplash to its top level dir, and then recreated the initrd, that was it, the progress bar didn't matter and it doesn't work, also i made a nice ubuntu theme
=== Shawnee entered the room.
[03:44] <Melda> rather than reinstalling another system
[03:44] <Priscila> Elli: Ahhh, I've never used that PAM stuff.
=== Edith left the room (quit: "Leaving").
[03:44] <Anya> How do you keep someone confined to their home directory? I'm having someone ssh'ing in for irssi, but I don't want them to access the rest of my system
[03:44] <Melda> so i was going to do an ls and grep out his username and then pull the file-paths from like awk '{ print $9 }' from the ls -l and do a | xargs chown root:root, etc
[03:45] <Priscila> Melda: sounds like you want find...
[03:45] <Felicia> Elli: and Pam? .. hrm .. sounds nice ;-)
[03:45] <Arlie> Julietta, ethernet packets dont care what data you put in them ... so long as you have a valid ethernet header with src and dest MAC addresses
[03:45] <Julietta> Arlie, the point is if you inject data into a open tcp connection, the original application maintaining that connection will recieve a ack for packet it didn't send which will likely result in a broken connection, which means i can't actually inject into a connection, it is NOT up to me
=== Latrina left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
[03:45] <Priscila> Melda: find has -user , to find files owned by user, and then has -exec , for executing command on said files.
[03:45] <Julietta> Arlie, ethernet packets don't but VALID implementations of tcp DO
=== Jeanice left the room (quit: "leaving").
[03:46] <Arlie> Julietta, of course ... you cant just start pretending to be another application or host, unless you have control over it
[03:46] <Arlie> Julietta, as in, man-in-the-middle
[03:46] <Julietta> yeah
[03:46] <Julietta> well, how would i do that
[03:46] <Julietta> on application level ?
[03:46] <Priscila> Melda: so you could do, find / -user user -exec chown root:root {} + , then just fix his home directory.
[03:46] <Julietta> like grab a handle to another apps socket
[03:46] <Elli> Felicia, heh =P
[03:46] <Priscila> Melda: although, do NOT do that actually.
[03:46] <Priscila> Melda: that will fsck up other things....
=== Abigail entered the room.
[03:47] <Abigail> does anyone know what they are doing with poppassd?
[03:47] <Arlie> Julietta, you can send open file descriptors from 1 app to another using message queues and IPC
[03:47] <Felicia> i smiled or sure ;-)
[03:47] <Felicia> er for*
[03:47] <Paulita> http://youtube.com/watch?v=UEOUWQ1Qm5I
[03:48] <Elli> Felicia, you've got a lively imagination for sure >.<
[03:48] <Arlie> Julietta, you can also have an app connect to a proxy, and have the proxy connect to wherever the app is supposed to, but it doesnt require libpcap
=== Shawnee left the room (quit: Client Quit).
[03:48] <Arlie> pcap is for capturing packets on the wire
[03:48] <Julietta> Arlie, is there any way to have that work without doing any modification to the app i want to grab the socket from ?
[03:48] <Arlie> Julietta, use a proxy
[03:48] <Julietta> well, except the proxy which i am actually coding right now
[03:48] <Felicia> these darned red blood cells and hormones keep acting up on me :-)
[03:49] <Elli> haha
=== Shawnee entered the room.
[03:49] <Arlie> Julietta, you can also rewrite packets, i think its a feature of iptables
[03:49] <Arlie> Julietta, you could, in theory, rewrite every outgoing tcp packet to connect to your local proxy instead of where it was going
[03:50] <Arlie> Julietta, using a userspace iptables filter
=== Laura entered the room.
[03:50] <Julietta> hmm, yeah
=== Cecile entered the room.
[03:51] <Arlie> no thanks required, just send money
=== Nichole left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
[03:52] <Laura> Hello, when I open a file I see a bunch of ^M
[03:52] <Laura> Is that bad in vi ?
=== mode/##linux mode (-o Kacy ) by Kacy
[03:52] <Paulita> wow dig this http://youtube.com/watch?v=nayarBrD6mk
[03:52] <Antonietta> Laura: it means it uses dos eol
[03:53] <Laura> how do I remove those?
=== Devin entered the room.
=== Elizabet left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
[03:53] <Laura> i don't think it matters thou, cause It works
[03:53] <Antonietta> Laura: tr -d '\r' < file > newfile
[03:54] <Elli> Hmm, reinstalled PAM, no change..

[03:55] <Laura> Gale: what is %s/
[03:55] <Gale> search and replace
[03:55] <Laura> I am don't use vi usually :/
[03:55] <Gale> but actually
=== Juana entered the room.
[03:56] <Gale> you probably want the second set of // to be a linefeed instead

[03:58] <Lonnie> hi
[03:58] <Gale> Laura: you could use sed instead of course
[03:58] <Lonnie> how do i determine the graphics card from command prompt
[03:58] <Lonnie> graphics card / ram / cpu speed etc
[03:58] <Laura> Gale: yea, but would like to learn VI though :)
=== Granville entered the room.
[03:59] <Granville> hello
[03:59] <Gale> Laura: you might also consider vim-gtk until you get proficient with vim
=== Sammie entered the room.
[03:59] <Gale> Laura: it's like the best of both worlds
[03:59] <Angla> ... unless you like emacs in kde
=== Sammie left the room.
=== Alvaro entered the room.
[04:00] <Laura> There is a problem
[04:00] <Laura> I opened a file in VI
[04:00] <Laura> Then I closed the terminal screen... now it says recover
[04:00] <Laura> So I open VI and type :recover
[04:00] <Laura> Then :wq
=== Sunni entered the room.
[04:00] <Laura> Then when I reopen that file it still asks me to recover :s
=== Gerri left the room (quit: Success).
=== Titus left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
[04:00] <Laura> so should I just delete the swap?
[04:01] <Felicia> Lonnie: lspci, and install and use hwinfo for more as well as cat /proc/cpuinfo
[04:01] <Gale> Laura: that can happen if say you openned it up again somewhere and edited it but the original occurance was still open
[04:01] <Gale> Laura: I would check it out first
[04:01] <Felicia> Lonnie: lspci | grep VGA for your video card
[04:01] <Laura> how would I check it out? i closed the terminal screen withought closing vi
[04:02] <Gale> open again with vim
[04:02] <Arlie> Madison, someone was in here earlier asking how to run mac osx on vmware ... i assued them of being you
[04:02] <Madison> wtf?
[04:02] <Madison> no
[04:02] <Laura> E325: ATTENTION
[04:02] <Laura> Found a swap file by the name ".UnrealTournament.ini.swp"
[04:02] <Laura> owned by: Laura dated: Wed May 23 17:42:09 2007
[04:02] <Laura> file name: /usr/local/games/ut/System/UnrealTournament.ini
[04:02] <Felicia> Lonnie: hwinfo --help list short options for quick info .. also use dmidecode for mobo info and dmesg | less
[04:02] <Gale> it's going to say that until you rm it iirc
[04:02] <Arlie> Madison, i thought you were trying to offer an osx virtual host ;)
[04:02] <Gale> rm the swap file
[04:02] <Madison> lol
[04:02] <Laura> okay
[04:03] <Madison> Arlie: naw
[04:03] <Gale> but make sure your main one is good first
[04:03] <Gale> I would
[04:03] <Madison> Arlie: i been working real hard on it the last 2 days
[04:03] <Madison> real hard
[04:03] <Madison> almost done
[04:03] <Felicia> Madison: we take Visa , Mastercard and Cash
=== Malvina entered the room.
[04:04] <Arlie> software is never done ... its only in various states of development, lacking features or having bugs
[04:04] <Laura> Gale: Aha so I opened it and then itopens, now I did %s/ctrlv ctrm
[04:04] <Laura> and saved it
[04:04] <Laura> and all the ^M removed
[04:04] <Laura> :)
[04:04] <Gale> yep
