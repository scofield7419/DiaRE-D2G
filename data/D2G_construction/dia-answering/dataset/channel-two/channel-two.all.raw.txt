[01:01] <Will> no you
[01:01] <Jaymie> Felicia: "denounce" and "snitch" map out two very distant points on the formality spectrum.
[01:01] <Chanel> how can I limit the speed of my internet connection to say, 100 KB/s ?
=== Malia entered the room.

[01:05] <Agatha> Hey guys, i think the proxy im using has been banned of a few channels, how do i get it unbanned?
[01:05] <Gale> if anything a whistleblower isn't necessarily something bad -- it might be someone that exposes say a factory that illegally puts their workers in danger
[01:05] <Felicia> Chanel: there's a certain networking keyword you need to use in a google, can't recall though what it's called precisely .. not bigding .. maybe throttling
[01:05] <Felicia> er s/bigding/bridging
[01:06] <Arlie> Gale, which risks everyones paycheck, which is bad

[01:08] <Gale> Arlie: I understand it's meaning all too well
[01:08] <Katherine> Tomorrow I am hopefully getting a GNU\Linux compatible wireless box to pick up wi-fi. I was wondering if anyone can recommend a distro which has an easy to use and configure wireless setup GUI. I have tried Debian but something has happened to their config GUI and it is completely different to the one shown in the help files.
[01:08] <Rachel> more appropriately termed "inhuman resources"
[01:08] <Gale> Arlie: precisely
[01:08] <Rachel> Gregg: thanks
[01:08] <Rea> anyone ?
[01:08] <Gale> Arlie: it really does
[01:08] <Arlie> Gale, which is why i encourage all factory workers to quit their jobs

=== Jolyn entered the room.
[01:10] <Jolyn> Hi all
=== Diana entered the room.
[01:10] <Rachel> Arlie: Whut?
[01:10] <Gale> there's a high quotient of dumb one in industrial jobs, that's for sure
[01:11] <Arlie> stupid people have crappy jobs ... and are forced to sing wal-mart songs, brainwashing themselves into staying
[01:11] <Felicia> what?
[01:11] <Diana> hi guys, can i get via sftp whole directory not individual files?
[01:11] <Rachel> there's a high quotient of dumb ones in management....
[01:11] <Katherine> On a different note, uptime of my PC is very important to me so I was wondering whether if I installed Linux onto a HDD using a spare PC then moved that HDD to my main PC would the linux still work?
[01:11] <Gale> Rachel: especially in management
=== Clara entered the room.

[01:11] <Diana> get -rR doesn't work;/
[01:11] <Rachel> Jolyn: boto images?
[01:11] <Arlie> Felicia, happens all the time ;)
[01:11] <Lashawna> what does SEO mean in a web dev context?
[01:11] <Gale> Rachel: especially in managment in industrial sector

[01:12] <Jesse> Katherine: why is uptime important to you?
[01:12] <Violette> Jolyn: mount them and cp -r the dirs
[01:12] <Rachel> because its not downtime!
[01:12] <Robert> how come I use ifconfig eth0 -arp, when I do tcpdump I still see ARP who-has <ip> tell <gatewayip>?
[01:12] <Jolyn> They are just directories
=== Francoise entered the room.
[01:12] <Robert> thx

[01:13] <Jolyn> I need to turn them into either a bootable ISO or disk images
[01:13] <Lashawna> it takes too long to load the channel list

[01:15] <Lashawna> maybe it isn't the right time in your life to be thinking about women
[01:15] <Lashawna> that's all I'm going to say
=== Jarrett entered the room.

[01:51] <Jeanice> very experimental stuff i understand... big YMMV stickers all over it
[01:51] <Arlie> ive never used vmware either
[01:51] <Santo> vmware is great
[01:51] <Blondell> vmmv ?
[01:51] <Santo> i've been using it for half a decade now
[01:51] <Arlie> no need for it

[01:52] <Arlie> i dont need to run my text editor or gcc in a virtual environment

[01:53] <Missy> how can i run 32-bit binaries on x86_64 ubuntu os?
[01:53] <Santo> I gave up on GIMP yesterday when I found it didn't have a "layer via cut"
[01:53] <Jeanice> Blondell: your mileage may vary - as in it isn't certain to work all that well, if at all
[01:53] <Margene> layer via cut?
=== Alec left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
[01:53] <Santo> And Layer Via Copy.
[01:53] <Santo> Which are two functions I use very heavily.
[01:53] <Adriana> Santo: iirc it has a paste as new layer (cut/copy and paste)

[01:54] <Rachel> copy from a layer , or by moving to a layer?

[01:54] <Jeanice> things are usually there, just renamed
[01:54] <Arlie> Santo, all that money to ms and adobe, just because you cant re-train yourself ... what a shame ;)

[01:54] <Hui> Missy: with difficulty, debian based distros don't support multilib for running 32bit and 64bit apps on the same system.
[01:54] <Santo> Arlie: what money? ;)
[01:54] <Rachel> Arr!
[01:54] <Hui> Missy: any rpm based distro and you'd be fine, on ubuntu you'll be stuck with chroot hacks.
[01:55] <Malcolm> I need to run fetchmail for myself all the time - I can run it as a daemon under my own login and it runs fine, and then survives even if i close my session. How should I script it to start when the machine boots, so I don't have to rememebr to start it manually?
[01:55] <Rachel> Malcolm: put it in rc.local
[01:55] <Rachel> use the deamon invocation

[01:56] <Rachel> Malcolm: sure - as long as the fetchmailrc is set up right, fetchmail takes care of the user ID issues.
[01:56] <Margene> pclos 2007 is out!
[01:57] <Jermaine> hi, I want to print the current date within a bash script like that 05232007 for example for taday, how can I do that?
[01:57] <Jermaine> today*
[01:57] <Meta> use date
[01:57] <Rachel> Malcolm: DAEMON MODE
[01:57] <Rachel> The --daemon <interval> or -d <interval> option runs fetchmail in daemon mode. You must specify a numeric argument which is a polling interval in seconds.

[01:59] <Malcolm> Rachel: If running as root, I need to set up a global config rather than ~/.fetchmailrc ?
[01:59] <Kathie> Jermaine: date '+%m%d%Y'
[01:59] <Rachel> Malcolm: yup
[01:59] <Malcolm> Rachel: I run it in daemon mode under my uid and it works very nicely
[01:59] <Jermaine> I got it.. thanks
[02:00] <Rachel> pretty much put same info in global location.

[02:01] <Sena> is there anyway to see what the CPU temperature is ?

[02:01] <Rachel> Specify a non-default name for the ~/.fetchmailrc run control file.
=== Thurman entered the room.
=== Anja left the room (quit: "burp").

[02:02] <Thurman> hi, do you have any recommendations for saving videos from a webcam in GNU/Linux?
[02:02] <Rachel> Malcolm: give yourself a promotion - You decide! ;-)
[02:02] <Malcolm> Rachel: there are a couple of oblique refs to running as root and that's it. And if I try to run it as root, it says "running as root is discouraged" and then exits :)

[02:13] <Malcolm> Rachel / Jesse: should i put the "set daemon" option in /etc/fetchmailrc ? I'm guessing not
=== Val entered the room.
[02:13] <Shenna> even dmesg says "hda:...."
[02:13] <Shenna> why is it so?
[02:13] <Elma> bye folks
[02:13] <Elma> Shenna: heu... not a damn clue, sorry... but why are using a 2.4 kernel?
=== Elma left the room.
[02:14] <Denny> Shenna, what are you trying to do?
[02:14] <Shenna> i am trying toswitch over ti 2.6
[02:14] <Melda> Elma: maybe because 2.6 still is getting root exploits as development goes on whereas 2.4 hasn't had any in a long time?
[02:14] <Tammi> hi, i am trying to dump a file system to a dat SCSI tapedrive. if i dump /var partition the speed is 1555KB/S, but if i dump the /home partition i barley get half that speed. Why would this be?
[02:14] <Denny> Melda, if you stick with around 2.6.12 its all cool

[02:18] <Melda> Shenna: check the dev entries? + some things change it... my laptop is definitely hda, my openbsd and 9/10 distributions recognize it that way - but for some reason my slackware sees it as being sda... just weird stuffs
[02:18] <Lizeth> 2.4 limited sata support?
=== Aldo entered the room.
[02:18] <Melda> Shenna: laptops are sort of odd in that way of sata/scsi/etc

[02:44] <Gale> it's like anything else. Has it's ups and downs
[02:44] <Margene> I say that all the time, maybe I should stop
=== Jordon left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
[02:44] <Arlie> i just posted a message to the mailing list
[02:45] <Arlie> anyone wanna bet money on the fact that i get a "sorry, doesnt exist, use the souce" response ?
[02:45] <Arlie> i'll pay 2:1 if im wrong
[02:45] <Gale> Arlie: I think it's the zealous fanatics that make that bold of statements
[02:45] <Margene> I hope you used foul language

[02:46] <Margene> too many goofy acronyms
[02:46] <Jana> is there an easy way on linux to see the current size of the TCP half-open connections queue, and the TCP accept queue? (redhat specifically, but I'd be happier with something that works on most linuxes, rather than something redhat-specific)
=== Crista left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
[02:47] <Maegan> I know it's not the leetest question in the word, but how do I remove those little bars that appear next to applets on the kde taskbar?
=== Alisa left the room (quit: "ircII EPIC5-0.3.3 -- Are we there yet?").
[02:47] <Nicki> have you poked around in /proc ?
=== Stacee left the room (quit: "Leaving.").
[02:47] <Jana> Nicki: I've been looking in /proc for a while but havne't found it
[02:48] <Jana> also tried sysctl -a | grep net.ipv4.tcp
[02:48] <Margene> Maegan, lock taskbar
[02:48] <Jana> and netstat -s
[02:48] <Yuki> does anyone run an ipv4 tunnel through ipv6 ?
[02:48] <Jana> they might be hiding in one of those, but I haven't found either one yet
[02:48] <Yuki> i'm trying to create my own hostname for irc
[02:48] <Margarette> how can i do this: i want to protect some information, namely a PDF, i create pdfs with htmldoc, ive a webserver with php and mysql... i want a user to get the pdf and only be able to use it from the computer he got it in, how can i do that? i know its a very broad question but im not sure where else to ask... oh... and it has to run on linux, but the PDF will most likely be seen on windows but i dont know

=== German entered the room.
[02:49] <Jana> Margarette: your question is vague, I can't quite tell what you're asking, but at first pass it looks like the answer is "you can't".
[02:49] <Margene> nothing should ever be seen on windows
[02:50] <Margene> except maybe a little devil gif flipping the bird

[02:52] <Gale> German: and what's that? Windows Genuine Advantage?
=== Cory entered the room.
[02:52] <Nicki> death to all extremists! ... oops
[02:52] <Margene> well you have to admit, having an advantage is advantageous
[02:52] <Jeanice> Gale: i feel so advantaged by that, actually
[02:52] <Angla> youtube does suck. who wants 15 minute max hosting ?
[02:53] <Paulita> hosting?
[02:53] <Josef> they give more if you sign up as a director
[02:53] <German> Gale, for example ease of installing additional programs. Unless the program you're looking for is in the repository you have to go through the dependency hell manually
=== Demetrius left the room (quit: Client Quit).
[02:53] <Paulita> i am talking about watching you idiot
[02:53] <Josef> I prefer Google Video tho
[02:53] <Gale> yeah, the advantage is not having it
[02:53] <Paulita> !seen Quiznos
[02:53] <Margene> I call it dependency heaven
[02:53] <Josef> German, Windows has Crysis, end of argument :P
[02:53] <Paulita> hi pingfloyd
[02:53] <Jeanice> plus, the advantage of laughing at all those who get sucked into its vortex of evil
[02:53] <Hildegard> Josef: yo.
=== Demetrius entered the room.
[02:54] <Angla> Paulita, youtube is a video HOSTING outfit. and you can just stop calling people idiots. especially those of a higher intellectual calibre than yourself
[02:54] <Josef> Hildegard, hi
=== Latrina entered the room.
[02:54] <Margene> haha, Crysis will bomb
[02:54] <Margene> bunch of hype
=== Christiana entered the room.
[02:54] <Josef> I bet otherwise
[02:54] <Josef> I'd put money on it but I don't think that's very freenode :P
[02:54] <Gale> German: ok, but each installation is like one more foot in the grave for it due to the dumbest thing every created -- the registry
[02:54] <Paulita> well if your defending idiots Angla, then your one too.
[02:54] <Paulita> now leave me be
[02:54] <Margene> well ok, gamer nerds always trend up on everything, but it's hype, so is directx10
[02:54] <Josef> Hildegard, it was you who brought the OpenOffice issue to my attention wasn't it?
=== Winter entered the room.
[02:55] <Hildegard> which issue would that be?
=== Katelynn left the room ("Saindo").
[02:55] <Josef> Margene, tbh DX10 is a big improvement, I'm not the trending type
[02:55] <Hildegard> licensing and sale of?
[02:55] <Josef> Hildegard, the ebay thing?
[02:55] <Josef> yup
=== Demetrius left the room (quit: Client Quit).
[02:55] <German> Gale, excuse my ignorance, but doesn't gnome have something similar?(never went into the details of it, but gconf looks like the registery)
[02:55] <Margene> yes, it's a bigger hype than usual
[02:55] <Paulita> all i did was make a brief statement and now i am suffering with all this grief :D
[02:55] <Josef> someone else I know put together an email to send them which I helped him with, not sure if he's sent it
[02:55] <Josef> gonna go over the legal side with a fine tooth comb tomorrow probably
[02:55] <Hildegard> Josef: what did you come up with?
[02:55] <Arlie> Paulita, happens to me all the time ;)
[02:56] <Paulita> hi Arlie
[02:56] <Arlie> Paulita, they love killing the messenger
=== Demetrius entered the room.
[02:56] <Gale> German: I don't know all the details of gnome, but those are just text files that gconf uses
[02:56] <Paulita> haha
=== Ashlie left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
=== Alana left the room (quit: "Leaving").
[02:56] <Josef> Hildegard, they're violating the terms of the license and are therefore illegally selling copyrighted material on ebay. should get the account closed, would be nice to see some refunds but I doubt ebay does that.
[02:56] <German> Gale, my own preference is each program having it's own .(name) directory in $home
[02:56] <Gale> German: more or less the whole gconf gui registry looking thing in gnome is really just a fancy front end for editing them
[02:56] <Gale> afaik
[02:56] <Angla> http://www.grc.com/stm/shootthemessenger.htm
[02:57] <Arlie> Paulita, but having just read the scrollback, you are being somewhat of a snot nosed punk
[02:57] <Paulita> Arlie you want to see my home town? it is on youtube :)
[02:57] <Hildegard> Josef: :D
[02:57] <Paulita> well fine then
[02:57] <Arlie> nope ... dont care at all
[02:57] <Paulita> good
[02:57] <Paulita> cause now i know you too
[02:57] <Hildegard> shutting down a powerseller, awesomeness.
[02:57] <German> Gale, okay but i do have a question here: don't windows ever update their libc? I heard that's what breaks most of the binary compatibility in linux
=== Emeline entered the room.
[02:57] <Arlie> Paulita, im sure it looks exactly like my home town
=== Kathryn left the room (quit: Read error: 113 (No route to host)).
[02:58] <Christiana> Anybody know a good OS for laptop? Has to support wifi - Office programs and firefox, i thought puppy linux or something.
[02:58] <Paulita> there is a major difference between a monkey hole and a bahia brazil ;)
[02:58] <Priscila> Christiana: why bother asking here?
[02:58] <Gale> German: windows has all sorts of problems with it's system libraries all the time

[03:03] <Priscila> Lynda: probably means the channel is full.
[03:04] <Christiana> I never used windows 95, it seems to run like crap
[03:04] <Margene> lose 95 was 32mb
[03:04] <Arlie> 4k was the norm for awhile
[03:04] <German> Jeanice, it sure ran on my 16mb, dunno about 8 though

[03:04] <Arlie> Christiana, what bios ?
[03:04] <Lynda> German: thanks !
[03:05] <Lynda> German: hey how do i recover a lost passworD? :)))
[03:05] <Hildegard> 98 was pretty fast even with 32, come to think of it.
[03:05] <Hildegard> at least until you started adding lots of stuff.
[03:05] <German> Margene, until you actually add some programs like antivirus and firewall...
[03:05] <Jeanice> i never had 98
[03:05] <Christiana> Bios is a blue screen with buttons when i pres F1 when pc boots, it says PASSWORD and BIOS

[03:08] <Arlie> for real
[03:08] <Angla> jackson browne had a hit with running on NT
[03:08] <Jeanice> that's GNU/communism
[03:08] <Arlie> microsoft is another enron

[03:20] <Margene> script kiddies mostly play with weak botnets ddosing forums
[03:20] <Ruthe> also reboot
[03:20] <Angla> is the *other* end of the cable plugged into the computer ?
[03:20] <Ruthe> just to be on the safe side
[03:21] <Gale> how about try that with stop and then start instead
=== Andy entered the room.
=== Gertrud is now known as Gertrud
=== Tiffaney stab's th pirate
[03:21] <Gertrud> :P
=== Gertrud left the room.
=== Giselle entered the room.
[03:21] <Ruthe> Angla, yes, the person im talking to has plugged the cable to the computer before
[03:22] <Ruthe> so at least Im sure he knows how to do that much
[03:22] <Angla> is there another cable to try ?
[03:22] <Gale> has he plugged in a power cable before though?
[03:22] <Ruthe> there is, but why would that same cable work on a different box?
=== Albertine is starting to hate his custom kernel
[03:22] <Leota> but i do love kde 3.5.7 :D
[03:23] <Ruthe> Gale, he is reading to me what he sees on the screen, system is on
[03:23] <Angla> Ruthe, trying as many possibilities as possible. it's *bound* to be something simple
=== Andy left the room (quit: Excess Flood).
=== Andy entered the room.
[03:24] <Renate> Leota, what's new in it compared to 3.5.6? lol
=== Voncile left the room (quit: "Leaving").
[03:24] <Gale> Ruthe: did you make sure the network module is loaded?
=== Andy left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
[03:24] <Leota> Renate: you get custom text colour for kicker, so you can have a black background in kicker with nice white text or whatever colour you want
[03:24] <Renate> oh... meh, guess it's nothing new then
[03:24] <Leota> and lots more... but kicker is the awesome bit
[03:25] <Margene> the kicker is the kicker
=== Justine left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
[03:25] <Angla> Ruthe, if i were you, i'd make a list of possible reasons why. and then systematically try them out. i wouldn't go assuming anything
=== Andrew entered the room.
[03:26] <Jeanice> you need a custom kernel for kde?
[03:26] <Gale> yeah, it's the assumptions that lead to nowhere
[03:26] <Gale> best thing to do is start with the simple and easy to overlook stuff and work your way up
[03:26] <Leota> Jeanice: no the stock kernel is fine
=== Fernando left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
[03:26] <Leota> Jeanice: i just wanted to add stuff like bootsplash, ubuntu's usplash sucks
[03:27] <Margene> I'll just wait for kde 4
[03:27] <Leota> and i wanted initng
=== Fernando entered the room.
[03:27] <Leota> Margene: long wait then...
[03:27] <Margene> till then I'll stick w/ xfce
[03:27] <Angla> the assumption that linux just decided to not work, is the least likely, by far
[03:27] <Renate> KDE4 is vaporware...
[03:27] <Jeanice> Leota: ah i see, sorry, i thought you made a custom kernel for kde. may i recommend gensplash btw
=== Blanche entered the room.
[03:27] <Margene> indeed it is, but 3.5 just doesn't cut it for me
[03:27] <Santo> Margene: why would you go from XFCE to KDE bloatware? Unless KDE4 will not be bloatware any longer...
[03:27] <Margene> Santo, not go, but try it out
=== Christina entered the room.
[03:28] <Santo> ah
=== Sena left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
[03:28] <Gale> Angla: or like I always say, "
[03:28] <Angla> ?
[03:28] <Margene> the only thing is there's a lot of qt apps that are really great
[03:28] <Gale> When it comes to troubleshooting, educated guesses are good, assumptions aren't
[03:28] <Christina> I have a question. I need to know the kernel parameter to use to tell an ubuntu install where the CD media is located at over a PXE server.
[03:28] <Delmar> has anyone used Xcircuit ? is that an app to draw and to test circiuts if theu work ?
=== Cyndy entered the room.
=== Cyndy left the room.
[03:29] <Angla> Gale, a calm methodical approach to narrowing the search space, then you shoot the dog that chewed the cable ...
=== Cyndy entered the room.
=== Lizbeth left the room (quit: "Leaving").
=== Cyndy left the room.
[03:29] <Margene> for example, kget is pretty much the only download manager I've tried that forces resuming on anything, while others fail
[03:29] <Leota> Jeanice: i tried gensplash so many times and i just gave up
[03:29] <Jeanice> Leota: what went wrong?
=== Amber left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
[03:30] <Leota> Jeanice: compiling it was the easy bit, messing with the startup scripts was where i got stuck
[03:30] <Gale> yeah, being methodical is a big part
[03:30] <Jeanice> Leota: ah, personally i don't use the progress bars
=== Kenya entered the room.
[03:31] <Renate> I'm not a big fan of kget :-\
[03:31] <Renate> then again, d4x is kinda broken too
=== Alina left the room (quit: "Leaving").
[03:32] <Margene> I've tried them all, kget is the only one that gets it done
=== Blanche left the room (quit: Client Quit).
[03:32] <Leota> Jeanice: well i couldn't get gensplash to compile, i just got errors, and had to install from some deb which completely failed, the error was related to the kernel
[03:32] <Margene> nothing in gtk2 that's for sure
=== Sena entered the room.
=== Gertrud entered the room.
[03:32] <Gertrud> ok i have an ext3 image
[03:32] <Renate> Margene, eh? yea, I haven't found a thing that can compare to flashget/fdm on Windows..
[03:32] <Gertrud> i did not unmount it cleanly
[03:33] <Renate> Gertrud, fsck
[03:33] <Gertrud> is there a way to fsck an image?
[03:33] <Gertrud> it throws an error when i try to fsck the image
[03:33] <Margene> archangle25, flashgot/kget works for me every time
[03:33] <Jeanice> Leota: what distro?
[03:33] <Gertrud> its not a disk turned into an image, its 30gb of /dev/zero turned into an ext3
[03:33] <Angla> downthemall works for me
[03:33] <Renate> Margene, well, I never said it didn't work, I just find it lacking in features
=== Cristi left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
=== Rocco entered the room.
[03:34] <Renate> (scripting)
=== Brande left the room (quit: ).
[03:34] <Margene> well I mean in linux at least, that's the only one that works for me when servers have anti-leech mechanisms
=== Britta entered the room.
=== Inez left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
=== Katherine left the room (quit: "g'night").
[03:35] <Renate> Margene, hint, if they don't want you to leech, don't leech
[03:35] <Margene> no, the problem is they don't just stop leeching, they stop resuming
=== Hassan left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
=== Nada left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
[03:35] <Leota> Jeanice: kubuntu
=== Hermila entered the room.
[03:35] <Arlie> posting stuff for download, then placing restrictions on downloading it, is against the communist manifesto of the OSS bowel movement
[03:35] <Margene> I'm sure it's a lot worse to restart a download and suck up even more bandwidth than to resume some multi GB file at 90%
=== Inez entered the room.
[03:36] <Julietta> can pcap inject packets into a open tcp connection ?
=== Felicitas left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
[03:36] <Arlie> pcap injects ethernet packets
[03:36] <Arlie> so yes
[03:36] <Arlie> they can be tcp,udp,ip, whatever
[03:36] <Renate> Margene, wait, if the file is non-resumable how do you resume it? o.O
[03:37] <Jeanice> Leota: http://jeandamiendurand.free.fr/debian/splashutils/ worked fine for me
[03:37] <Margene> Renate, I dunno, it just happens
[03:37] <Renate> magic, zomg! :o.O
[03:37] <Margene> you send it through flashgot to the downloader again, and it automagically resumes
[03:38] <Julietta> Arlie, yeah, but don't tcp connections have state information that prevent direct injection like that ?
[03:38] <Leota> Jeanice: those are the debs i tried, it messed with the entire apt-get install process, it couldn't run the post install process because the ubuntu startup scripts are so different and because the pre-uninstall scripts couldn't also be run the hole thing fell apart
[03:38] <Arlie> Julietta, you can inject garbage if you want
=== Sandy entered the room.
[03:38] <Arlie> Julietta, or you can steal someones connection
=== Clara left the room (quit: No route to host).
=== Ramona entered the room.
[03:39] <Arlie> Julietta, how any 1 particular tcp stack decides to respond to your garabge depends on its implementation
=== Celsa entered the room.
[03:40] <Julietta> i actually neither want to steal the connection nor i want to inject garbage (data that is not getting accepted by a valid implementation)
[03:40] <Elli> Hmm
[03:40] <Celsa> good morning
[03:40] <Gertrud> hey Renate is there some special option to pass fsck to get it to fsck my ext3 image?
[03:40] <Elli> Any idea why 'passwd' would ask for a new password four times?
=== Crista entered the room.
[03:40] <Priscila> Elli: A hacked version.
[03:41] <Melda> is there a way to get ls -l to print full path in each response?
[03:41] <Arlie> Julietta, do whatever you want ... its an ethernet packet
[03:41] <Leota> Jeanice: i had to replace most of the the startup scripts with just echo boo, the problem seemed to be with the kernel not being detected or something
[03:41] <Melda> so it'll show /home/user/filename.jpg at the end of every single line?
[03:41] <Elli> Priscila, yeah that could be a possbility except I just recompiled it from sources, thinking just that
=== Georgeanna entered the room.
[03:41] <Melda> vs just showing filename.jpg?
[03:41] <Elli> And still the same behavious
[03:41] <Priscila> Elli: Hmmm. Weird indeed ..
[03:41] <Julietta> Arlie, well, i can't, to actually inject valid packets i would need to modify the sockets state
[03:41] <Jeanice> Leota: strange... and what errors did you get when you tried to compile?
[03:41] <Priscila> Melda: ls -l /home/user/*
=== Giselle left the room.
[03:41] <Elli> Ya
[03:42] <Priscila> Elli: I assume you can trust where you gott he sources from?
[03:42] <Arlie> Julietta, use libpcap to do whatever you want ... your sending ethernet packets ... send valid tcp or dont ... its up to you
[03:43] <Leota> Jeanice: don't have that info at the moment, this kernel only has the bootsplash patch
[03:43] <Melda> godlfish: anyway to do that recursively? like with ls -alR to show full paths/permissions on every file in a tree?
=== Arlinda left the room ("Coming Back").
=== Arlinda entered the room.
=== Stefani left the room (quit: "Working on heaven's door").
=== Emilio left the room (quit: "Leaving").
=== Anneliese left the room (quit: "Leaving").
[03:43] <Jeanice> Leota: fair enough
[03:43] <Priscila> Melda: use find, find /home/user/ -exec ls -l {} +
[03:43] <Elli> Priscila, yeah
[03:44] <Felicia> Melda: alias it in your ~/.bashrc
[03:44] <Elli> Priscila, it might be a PAM module problem actually, hmm
[03:44] <Priscila> Melda: actually. that will just do the same thing.
[03:44] <Melda> goldfish: my actual application is a cleint chmod'd "/" to this user... so I want to change EVERYTHING owned by this user on the system to "root:root" and then just fix his homedir
[03:44] <Leota> Jeanice: bootsplash seemed to be easier to install, i added the bootsplash patch, then used splas bla bla > bootsplash, then extracted my initrd file using cpio and added bootsplash to its top level dir, and then recreated the initrd, that was it, the progress bar didn't matter and it doesn't work, also i made a nice ubuntu theme
=== Shawnee entered the room.
[03:44] <Melda> rather than reinstalling another system
[03:44] <Priscila> Elli: Ahhh, I've never used that PAM stuff.
=== Edith left the room (quit: "Leaving").
[03:44] <Anya> How do you keep someone confined to their home directory? I'm having someone ssh'ing in for irssi, but I don't want them to access the rest of my system
[03:44] <Melda> so i was going to do an ls and grep out his username and then pull the file-paths from like awk '{ print $9 }' from the ls -l and do a | xargs chown root:root, etc
[03:45] <Priscila> Melda: sounds like you want find...
[03:45] <Felicia> Elli: and Pam? .. hrm .. sounds nice ;-)
[03:45] <Arlie> Julietta, ethernet packets dont care what data you put in them ... so long as you have a valid ethernet header with src and dest MAC addresses
[03:45] <Julietta> Arlie, the point is if you inject data into a open tcp connection, the original application maintaining that connection will recieve a ack for packet it didn't send which will likely result in a broken connection, which means i can't actually inject into a connection, it is NOT up to me
=== Latrina left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
[03:45] <Priscila> Melda: find has -user , to find files owned by user, and then has -exec , for executing command on said files.
[03:45] <Julietta> Arlie, ethernet packets don't but VALID implementations of tcp DO
=== Jeanice left the room (quit: "leaving").
[03:46] <Arlie> Julietta, of course ... you cant just start pretending to be another application or host, unless you have control over it
[03:46] <Arlie> Julietta, as in, man-in-the-middle
[03:46] <Julietta> yeah
[03:46] <Julietta> well, how would i do that
[03:46] <Julietta> on application level ?
[03:46] <Priscila> Melda: so you could do, find / -user user -exec chown root:root {} + , then just fix his home directory.
[03:46] <Julietta> like grab a handle to another apps socket
[03:46] <Elli> Felicia, heh =P
[03:46] <Priscila> Melda: although, do NOT do that actually.
[03:46] <Priscila> Melda: that will fsck up other things....
=== Abigail entered the room.
[03:47] <Abigail> does anyone know what they are doing with poppassd?
[03:47] <Arlie> Julietta, you can send open file descriptors from 1 app to another using message queues and IPC
[03:47] <Felicia> i smiled or sure ;-)
[03:47] <Felicia> er for*
[03:47] <Paulita> http://youtube.com/watch?v=UEOUWQ1Qm5I
[03:48] <Elli> Felicia, you've got a lively imagination for sure >.<
[03:48] <Arlie> Julietta, you can also have an app connect to a proxy, and have the proxy connect to wherever the app is supposed to, but it doesnt require libpcap
=== Shawnee left the room (quit: Client Quit).
[03:48] <Arlie> pcap is for capturing packets on the wire
[03:48] <Julietta> Arlie, is there any way to have that work without doing any modification to the app i want to grab the socket from ?
[03:48] <Arlie> Julietta, use a proxy
[03:48] <Julietta> well, except the proxy which i am actually coding right now
[03:48] <Felicia> these darned red blood cells and hormones keep acting up on me :-)
[03:49] <Elli> haha
=== Shawnee entered the room.
[03:49] <Arlie> Julietta, you can also rewrite packets, i think its a feature of iptables
[03:49] <Arlie> Julietta, you could, in theory, rewrite every outgoing tcp packet to connect to your local proxy instead of where it was going
[03:50] <Arlie> Julietta, using a userspace iptables filter
=== Laura entered the room.
[03:50] <Julietta> hmm, yeah
=== Cecile entered the room.
[03:51] <Arlie> no thanks required, just send money
=== Nichole left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).

[03:52] <Paulita> wow dig this http://youtube.com/watch?v=nayarBrD6mk

[03:58] <Lonnie> how do i determine the graphics card from command prompt
[03:58] <Lonnie> graphics card / ram / cpu speed etc
[03:58] <Laura> Gale: yea, but would like to learn VI though :)
=== Granville entered the room.
[03:59] <Granville> hello

[03:59] <Angla> ... unless you like emacs in kde
=== Sammie left the room.
=== Alvaro entered the room.
[04:00] <Laura> There is a problem
[04:00] <Laura> I opened a file in VI
[04:00] <Laura> Then I closed the terminal screen... now it says recover
[04:00] <Laura> So I open VI and type :recover
[04:00] <Laura> Then :wq

[04:00] <Laura> Then when I reopen that file it still asks me to recover :s
=== Gerri left the room (quit: Success).
=== Titus left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
[04:00] <Laura> so should I just delete the swap?
[04:01] <Felicia> Lonnie: lspci, and install and use hwinfo for more as well as cat /proc/cpuinfo
[04:01] <Gale> Laura: that can happen if say you openned it up again somewhere and edited it but the original occurance was still open
[04:01] <Gale> Laura: I would check it out first
[04:01] <Felicia> Lonnie: lspci | grep VGA for your video card
[04:01] <Laura> how would I check it out? i closed the terminal screen withought closing vi
[04:02] <Gale> open again with vim
[04:02] <Arlie> Madison, someone was in here earlier asking how to run mac osx on vmware ... i assued them of being you

[04:02] <Felicia> Lonnie: hwinfo --help list short options for quick info .. also use dmidecode for mobo info and dmesg | less
[04:02] <Gale> it's going to say that until you rm it iirc
[04:02] <Arlie> Madison, i thought you were trying to offer an osx virtual host ;)
[04:02] <Gale> rm the swap file
[04:02] <Madison> lol
[04:02] <Laura> okay
[04:03] <Madison> Arlie: naw
[04:03] <Gale> but make sure your main one is good first
[04:03] <Gale> I would
[04:03] <Madison> Arlie: i been working real hard on it the last 2 days
[04:03] <Madison> real hard
[04:03] <Madison> almost done
[04:03] <Felicia> Madison: we take Visa , Mastercard and Cash
=== Malvina entered the room.
[04:04] <Arlie> software is never done ... its only in various states of development, lacking features or having bugs
[04:04] <Laura> Gale: Aha so I opened it and then itopens, now I did %s/ctrlv ctrm
[04:04] <Laura> and saved it
[04:04] <Laura> and all the ^M removed

[04:06] <Laura> I want to search for bEnabled

[04:06] <Laura> And it gives me a line, but I want to change bEnabled to true
=== Ernest left the room (quit: ).
[04:06] <Ramonita> hey all
[04:06] <Laura> Can I search for a line, and just edit it?
[04:06] <Gale> Laura: yeah, you could search and then manually fix if you wanted, but you could use the search and replace feature I showed instead
=== Sena left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
[04:07] <Gale> you mean like change "bEnabled" to "bEnabled=true"?
=== Devin left the room (quit: "Leaving").
[04:07] <Laura> yea
[04:07] <Laura> errr
[04:08] <Alanna> hi guys, I am not a very good linux user, so I would like to try out a version which is accessible to me, which has a great desktop envornment, etc so what would I use, till now I have full cds of slack 11.0 and redhat enterprise 5
[04:08] <Laura> I can't press DOWN arrow ?

=== Ute left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
[04:08] <Ruthe> ok, problem solved, thanks Angla, Gale
[04:08] <Alanna> what do you recommend me
[04:08] <Gale> if you're using VI as apposed to vim, then probably
[04:08] <Gale> vi isn't as flexible
=== Alma entered the room.
[04:08] <Gale> Ruthe: what was it>?
[04:09] <Cordia> `abo - you are going to get different responces from different people so i usualy suggest checking distrowatch.com for a description of each OS
[04:09] <Laura> Gale: but when I do %s/bEnabled it replaces bEnabled by empty string
[04:09] <Gale> Laura: you need more than that
[04:09] <Ruthe> Gale, cable modem learns the mac addr of the last box it handled the dhcp request for
=== Carey left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
[04:09] <Gale> it's like this :%s/oldstring/newstring/options
[04:09] <Ruthe> after that, it wont let any other mac addr request a dhcp offer
[04:10] <Laura> Gale: ah okay
[04:10] <Ruthe> modem needs to be turned off for a few seconds
[04:10] <Laura> Gale: I will just use :/bEnabled :)
[04:10] <Margene> and unplugged
[04:10] <Gale> there's also another variant that :s/oldstring/newstring/options

[04:12] <Nestor> i've tried kill PID and kill -TERM PID an the proccess is still there unaffected
[04:12] <Ruthe> Gale, yeah you were right, my stupidity was resetting it while it was connected to the xp box
[04:12] <Laura> Gale: thanks :) All worked
[04:12] <Jeanna> Nestor
[04:12] <Jeanna> ttry kill -9 pid
[04:12] <Margene> send a cyborg back in time to kill the process' mother
[04:12] <Ruthe> so it would relearn the xp mac
[04:12] <Jeanna> -9 sends the kill signal
[04:12] <Laura> Now I gotta figure out unreal tournament itself WebServer Entry.WebServer0 (Function UWeb.WebServer.BeginPlay:01ED) BindPort: bind failed
[04:12] <Laura> heh
[04:12] <Jeanna> but you should always send SIGTERM first
[04:13] <Gale> Ruthe: it also may have required being fully powered down for 10 or so seconds
[04:13] <Jeanna> Laura, ever chat on msn chat?
[04:13] <Elli> I hate how one miss-typed char in one single config file can mess things up so badly
[04:13] <Gale> Ruthe: however long it takes for it to completely reset
=== Lannie entered the room.
[04:13] <Nestor> Jeanna: i've tried sending SIGTERM but that didn't work either
[04:13] <Ruthe> Gale, yep, thats what did it
=== Lannie left the room ("Me jui...!").
[04:13] <Jeanna> ok well use kill -9 <pid>
[04:13] <Jeanna> that will force a process to exit
[04:13] <Nestor> can i use some sort of wildcard to kill them?
=== Julissa left the room (quit: " HydraIRC -> http://www.hydrairc.com <- Try something fresh").
[04:13] <Nestor> Jeanna: yes, that one worked
[04:14] <Gale> Ruthe: that's like one of the first things I always do with any dsl or cable modem
[04:14] <Nestor> i want to kill all the processes between PIDs 27040 and 27050
[04:14] <Gale> Ruthe: when their is some weirdness going on

[04:14] <Elli> Nestor, kill -9 270[4-5]0 maybe?
[04:15] <Elli> Nestor, err nm, that wont work
[04:15] <Jeanna> sarah, i didn't know the kill command supported regex
[04:15] <Nestor> Elli: ok.
[04:15] <Jeanna> but even if it did, that would be incorrect

=== Ricardo entered the room.
=== Julietta left the room (quit: "Leaving").
[05:05] <Ricardo> Is there a way to emulate input for a program listening on a COM port? like send the input in such a way that the program thinks it's getting it from the COM?
[05:05] <Arlie> its a federal reserve european banker tax man judge landlord conspiracy !
[05:05] <Azzie> Lai: I am certainly willing to help and send you what little money I can, but I'm sure A paypal would help a lot more.
[05:05] <Lai> lol
=== Lora left the room (quit: "IceChat - Keeping PC's cool since 2000").
[05:05] <Felicia> yep
[05:05] <Hildegard> Arlie: but it's actually masterminded by the street hotdog salesman

=== Mable left the room (quit: Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)).
[05:06] <Felicia> vendor! not salesman ..;lol
[05:06] <Lai> Azzie: i am truly grateful for the effort; but i cant see how i'd get the money out of paypal?
[05:06] <Arlie> Lai, if you ever get a computer and an isp again, by all means, setup a website and start selling vitamins or something ... you have the skills to do it, you just keep thinking you dont need money
[05:06] <Lai> lol remind me of that one
[05:06] <Azzie> Lai: You do need a bank account, but there shouldnt be any reason you couldnt have one?
[05:06] <Arlie> selling vitamins is a worthy profession ... people need vitamins
[05:07] <Lai> Azzie: lol; ask HM why :)
[05:07] <Lai> lol
[05:07] <Angla> Arlie, you are one cold mother
[05:07] <Lai> or search the logs of months past
[05:07] <Arlie> Angla, im not cold, im desensitized
[05:07] <Gigi> Josephina: What's the relationship with cygwin please?
[05:07] <Arlie> if Q has bad credit, it will be hard to get a bank account
[05:07] <Arlie> however, it can be done
[05:08] <Angla> anyways, i've used up all my fast-forward on this mythtv. back later
=== Ronald left the room (quit: ).
=== Adele left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
[05:08] <Azzie> Not a simple checking account, you may have to offer them to keep your debit card though.
[05:08] <Lai> i still think a $15 or $20 debit cards would be a better idear
[05:08] <Delmar> has anyone used pcb ?
[05:08] <Lai> Angla: be well
[05:08] <Arlie> Azzie, yes, even a simple checking account requires that you didnt screw up your last checking account, which is easy to do if you have no money
[05:08] <Lai> or plain money orders
=== Alana left the room.
[05:09] <Lai> or postal orders
=== Les entered the room.

[05:09] <Lai> i give you the mailing address of where to send them- to the manager of property
[05:09] <Josephina> Gigi: no relationship, they do the same sort of thing, but are different in several ways. I recommend mingw+msys but have used cygwin and got no problem with it
[05:09] <Angelika> that user is anybody???
[05:09] <Ricardo> #offtopic :D
[05:09] <Angelika> or that it dosent have ownership???

[05:10] <Hallie> What's a good way to keep a svn repository that depends on another upstream svn repository?
=== Vashti left the room (quit: Read error: 145 (Connection timed out)).
[05:10] <Lashawna> what are the chances a 16 year old sophomore who's been programming since 10 can a job with google?
[05:10] <Mirta> what's up sir?
[05:10] <Lai> Alisa: heh
[05:11] <Arlie> Lai, get busy designing a website to accept hurricane relief donations and pay yourself a percentage as a salary ... hurricane season is starting again

=== Virgina left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
[05:11] <Ricardo> Alisa: hehe, what's up? I'm just here trying to figure out how the hell I can try to send commands into a program listening on the parallel com port
[05:11] <Alisa> Lashawna: as a 16 year old Junior also lusting for a job at google, I think you've got better chances than I, at very least.
[05:11] <Mirta> Hey - dude - I like got a job interview tomorrow finally.
[05:11] <Lai> cool
[05:11] <Josephina> Ricardo: I thought com port was serial
[05:11] <Alisa> Ricardo: nothing too important...just celebrating the return of Lai :`)
[05:11] <Lashawna> Mirta, but how old r u
[05:11] <Mirta> 34
[05:11] <Lashawna> Mirta, and do you have a degree?
[05:12] <Arlie> sure, work at google, just dont take stock options in leiu of salary
[05:12] <Lai> heh
[05:12] <Mirta> 2 years.
[05:12] <Azzie> Lashawna: Im a 19 year old coder who has been coding sine at least 10 and am in the same position.
[05:12] <Arlie> at $460 a share for a company that has yet to make $1 in profit ... its not a good deal
[05:12] <Lai> heh
[05:12] <Ricardo> Josephina: you know, I think you're right, but it doesn't matter for what I'm trying to do, but it is serial, I'm just retarded lol
[05:12] <Lai> ok, so where are we on the relif?
=== Sara left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
[05:12] <Azzie> Lashawna: The key with that company is to do get a good degree and do something big in school.
[05:12] <Josephina> Ricardo: hehe ok
[05:12] <Azzie> from what i hear..
[05:12] <Lai> should i post a mialing address to send it to?
[05:13] <Alisa> !seen Kacy
[05:13] <Lai> this would be a one shot thing tho cuz i cant rejoin later to remind
[05:13] <Nicki> Lashawna: Here's a hint. Don't go around telling people you've been programming since 10. (yes, I know it's likely literally true. But it shows immaturity to claim it the same way professional programmers cite their years of experience.))
=== Malcom left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
[05:13] <Josephina> Ricardo: and linux doesn't call it a com port, it's called a serial tty or something
[05:13] <Mirta> Lashawna - who are you and why does it matter so much? People who know me know that this is a step forward.
[05:13] <Lashawna> I'm just tired of working for myself
=== Shayna entered the room.
[05:14] <Alisa> Lai: yeah. Post it. I'll see if we can get Kacy to put it in the /topic :)))
[05:14] <Arlie> Lashawna, no, screw that, if your good, let everyone know it, except your co-workers
[05:14] <Josephina> Ricardo: and how to make a program think it's receiving data from it, would depend on how the program is receiving data from it
[05:14] <Ricardo> Josephina: ah thanks for the heads up
[05:14] <Felicia> Lai: sure . can't hurt .. or open a temp new channel and let everyone interested join .. then take it from there
=== Laraine entered the room.
[05:14] <Ricardo> Josephina: yeah, it's using some library to do it, guess I need to figure out how that library works
[05:14] <Felicia> Lai: open a channel called #Lai ;-)
[05:14] <Lashawna> Arlie, my brother told me that one?
[05:14] <Josephina> Ricardo: ah ok
[05:14] <Lai> ok; but someone else is gonna have to remind others
[05:14] <Felicia> Lai: oh .. whatever then
[05:14] <Azzie> Someone make a quizrelief bot
=== Alice entered the room.
[05:14] <Arlie> Lashawna, co-workers are evil ... they'll screw you up if your good enough to make them look bad .... they operate based on fear
[05:14] <Mirta> hello Azzie
[05:15] <Ricardo> I am half way done with a 4 year degree and working with a company designing software for night vision cameras, co-op programs rock
=== Mable entered the room.
[05:15] <Lai> what whatever?
[05:15] <Lai> huh?
[05:15] <Nicki> Arlie: only at crappy places. :)
[05:15] <Azzie> Ricardo: Hello there, how is it going?
[05:15] <Arlie> Nicki, it happens everywhere
[05:15] <Felicia> Lai: i figured to keep it a bit erm private
[05:15] <Lashawna> Arlie, that's interesting
[05:15] <Nicki> Arlie: cynic. :)
[05:15] <Arlie> Nicki, at least, anywhere were there is a gap in skill levels
[05:15] <Arlie> its human nature
[05:15] <Ricardo> Azzie: pretty good, just at the office, about to leave
[05:15] <Ricardo> how are you?
[05:15] <Lai> Felicia: ok i'm bumming here; fizzle
[05:16] <Felicia> Lai: if everyone needs to mail to that address on their own then maybe it';s beetter you spm it and it get's spammed ;-P
[05:16] <Azzie> Ricardo: Well, end of semester work, what could be better?
=== Angelika left the room ("Konversation terminated!").
[05:16] <Nicki> Arlie: well, I've never been "screwed up" by a junior programmer. they come to me for help.
[05:16] <Josephina> Ricardo: if it's just reading from /dev/ttyS0 or something you could somehow get it to just read from a named pipe instead
[05:16] <Arlie> Nicki, no no no ... someone below you is not a co-worker, they are an underling
[05:16] <Lai> Felicia: ok then what?
[05:16] <Ricardo> Azzie: I hate that crap... you in college?
[05:16] <Lashawna> ok, so my chances with google are probably slim, does anyone know of a company in need of experienced html, css, jscript, perl, python, etc. programmers?
[05:16] <Nicki> Arlie: the sr programmers come to me for help, also. :)
[05:17] <Lashawna> Nicki, then you should get promoted
[05:17] <Ricardo> Josephina: hmm yeah maybe you're right... I might just have to end up modifying the entire program
[05:17] <Arlie> Nicki, yes, but them comming to you, and you making them look bad, are 2 different issues
=== Katherin entered the room.
[05:17] <Felicia> Lai: post the info .. atleast it'll be logged soemwhere then .. i didn't know what/who's address you were going to throw out
=== Izetta left the room (quit: Nick collision from services.).
=== Tena entered the room.
=== Katherin left the room (quit: Excess Flood).
[05:17] <Ricardo> just to read from a different input stream
[05:17] <Azzie> Ricardo: Indeed, trying to decide if im going to keep putting up with this or just start coding for myself.
[05:17] <Tena> hey, anyone know if theres any way i can play songs i bought on itunes in linux?
=== Izetta entered the room.
[05:17] <Azzie> Tena: No, and thats what you get for buying from ITunes.
[05:17] <Ricardo> finish college at least, how many more years you have?
[05:18] <Lai> Felicia: the address to -- you know what, i think it's not such a good idear
[05:18] <Azzie> Ricardo: 3 at least.
[05:18] <Ricardo> Tena: you just need to get the m4a/mp4 plugin
=== Maegan left the room (quit: "I'm leaving.").
[05:18] <Felicia> Lai: see.. ok .. think about it ..
[05:18] <Ricardo> Azzie: you are a freshman this year and already tired of it?
[05:18] <Lai> yea i am
[05:18] <Nicki> Lashawna: I'm paid well. I don't care about job titles. and I enjoy troubleshooting for others. :)
[05:18] <Azzie> Ricardo: I would rather be coding!
=== Dagny entered the room.
[05:18] <Felicia> Lai: or PM one of us .. or whatever ..
[05:18] <Ricardo> Azzie: there is a lot of coding to be done in college lol
[05:18] <Lai> crap
[05:18] <Arlie> Lai, i feel for you, but im not sending you any money
[05:19] <Lai> k
[05:19] <Alisa> Lashawna: look on jobs.com, also jobs.perl.com.
[05:19] <Ricardo> Azzie: get on some open source projects like KDE or gaim or gcc or something
[05:19] <Felicia> so what .. that's just one monkey Q
[05:19] <Azzie> Ricardo: Either that, or transfer to a school where I can find a teacher who is as interested in independent coding projects as I am.
[05:19] <Felicia> there's many more of us apes about
[05:19] <Dorthy> the interesting CS classes don't start until your junior/senior year, especially if you're already familiar with the languages being taught and basic data structure concepts
[05:19] <Arlie> Felicia, hey man, i was homeless and noone sent me any money
=== Horacio entered the room.
[05:20] <Ricardo> Dorthy: true.. I am going into my third year, finally get to do AI and OS and compilers, etc
[05:20] <Azzie> Ricardo: I'm trying, but the problem is that I have to spend far too much time on schoolwork, even though im paying 30k/year for it.
[05:20] <Lai> Arlie: did you ask?
=== Cornelius left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
[05:20] <Arlie> Lai, no
[05:20] <Lai> ok then
[05:20] <Dagny> How can I discover which library file(s) contain an exported function name? I'm having a problem with linking against libpci.a and gzopen, and thinking another library may have declared the names
[05:20] <Azzie> classic
[05:20] <Arlie> Lai, if you have a truck load of stuff, why dont you sell it
[05:20] <Ricardo> Azzie: hehe but it's only 3 more years... that's really short when you think abou tit.. I'd say just bear through it and get your degree, it's going to make it a lot easier to find a job and you'll get paid more
[05:20] <Lai> i dont have access to my stuff atm
[05:20] <Arlie> Lai, then when your out of stuff, find a south bound train and jump on it
[05:21] <Alisa> Azzie: hah, the CS professors at the local university are A.) A man with a degree in parsing, not teaching CS, and B.)A woman who is a MAJOR microserf.
[05:21] <Nicki> Dagny: strings and grep? ;)
[05:21] <Lai> Arlie: yea or bus
[05:21] <Arlie> Lai, wheres all your stuff ?
[05:21] <Lai> Arlie: in the apt i was evicted from
=== Velva entered the room.
=== Na entered the room.
[05:21] <Arlie> Lai, go get it
=== Daphne left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
[05:21] <Dagny> Is that it? With having ldconfig I thought there must be a location for the list of exported functions
[05:21] <Ricardo> Lai: why'd you get evicted? I missed the first half of this conversation
=== Daphne entered the room.
[05:22] <Azzie> Alisa: Luckilly at my school there are no microserfs :-). We all have to do our coding with gcc. The problem is most the profs just teach as a side job so they have their hands more than full.
[05:22] <Ricardo> Josephina: lol I think it'd be much easier if I just modified the program....
[05:22] <Lai> Ricardo: alledged non-payment of rent
[05:22] <Ricardo> so I'm going to do taht
=== Cedrick left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
[05:22] <Nicki> Dagny: or grepping the source code or the documentation of the apis
[05:22] <Arlie> Lai, you mean, payment of rent with junk bonds ?
[05:22] <Lai> Arlie: i wont trespass

[05:23] <Ricardo> alright guys time for me to drive home, bbl
[05:23] <Dagny> Nicki hmmm, i'll see if grep helps, source-code isn't an option for this
=== Ricardo left the room.
[05:24] <Arlie> Lai, and i commend you on the fact that your not like that, but because you live in a world constructed by people who are, you have to play by their rules at least enough to survive
[05:24] <Lai> Felicia:
[05:24] <Felicia> yo yo
[05:24] <Lai> Alisa: seconds really, and i need to do one other thing too
=== Gene left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).

[05:25] <Lai> latter
[05:25] <Nicki> why do you say "alleged" non-payment? did you pay or didn't you? :)

=== Margery left the room (quit: "Konversation terminated!").
[05:25] <Azzie> Thats aweful, bust the door down.
[05:25] <Velva> If i link the two homes folders ie. ff & gg to xx, then I can log in as xx, but how can I choose which link to follow?
[05:25] <Lai> Nicki: i discharged the debt and sent a bond
[05:26] <Felicia> Lai: i mean the address that you can trust us to mail money to
[05:26] <Arlie> Felicia, western union
[05:26] <Arlie> Felicia, he can get it anywhere with a password
[05:26] <Felicia> in C/o ?
[05:26] <Lai> Felicia: ok ignore that last
[05:26] <Felicia> what? i didn;t get anything ..lol

[05:48] <Madison> romance languages are fine ..........english kills it for flexibility though
[05:49] <Santo> i think when i was 7 i spoke half-assed-fluent italian because i watched italian-dubbed anime all day long
[05:49] <Madison> english is still a latin language just not a romance language

[05:51] <Nicki> I learned my money handling skills from playing MUDs, I save it up, then I spend it after I have it. :)
[05:52] <Madison> Santo: i could get 5/10 jobs with no port or resume
