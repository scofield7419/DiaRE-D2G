[01:01] <Will> no you
[01:01] <Jaymie> Felicia: "denounce" and "snitch" map out two very distant points on the formality spectrum.
[01:01] <Chanel> how can I limit the speed of my internet connection to say, 100 KB/s ?
=== Malia entered the room.
=== Delmer left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
[01:01] <Felicia> tell it to manpages Jaymie ;-)

[01:05] <Agatha> Hey guys, i think the proxy im using has been banned of a few channels, how do i get it unbanned?
[01:05] <Gale> if anything a whistleblower isn't necessarily something bad -- it might be someone that exposes say a factory that illegally puts their workers in danger
[01:05] <Felicia> Chanel: there's a certain networking keyword you need to use in a google, can't recall though what it's called precisely .. not bigding .. maybe throttling
[01:05] <Felicia> er s/bigding/bridging
[01:06] <Arlie> Gale, which risks everyones paycheck, which is bad
[01:06] <Lilliana> PoNg

[01:07] <Gale> because their boss manipulated them into doing something that was against safety protocols so he could get his brownie points

[01:08] <Gale> Arlie: of course
[01:08] <Arlie> Gale, that pretty much sums it up ;)
[01:08] <Gale> Arlie: I understand it's meaning all too well
[01:08] <Katherine> Tomorrow I am hopefully getting a GNU\Linux compatible wireless box to pick up wi-fi. I was wondering if anyone can recommend a distro which has an easy to use and configure wireless setup GUI. I have tried Debian but something has happened to their config GUI and it is completely different to the one shown in the help files.
[01:08] <Rachel> more appropriately termed "inhuman resources"
[01:08] <Gale> Arlie: precisely
[01:08] <Rachel> Gregg: thanks
[01:08] <Rea> anyone ?
[01:08] <Gale> Arlie: it really does
[01:08] <Arlie> Gale, which is why i encourage all factory workers to quit their jobs

=== Jolyn entered the room.
[01:10] <Jolyn> Hi all
=== Diana entered the room.
[01:10] <Rachel> Arlie: Whut?
[01:10] <Gale> there's a high quotient of dumb one in industrial jobs, that's for sure
[01:11] <Arlie> stupid people have crappy jobs ... and are forced to sing wal-mart songs, brainwashing themselves into staying
[01:11] <Felicia> what?
[01:11] <Diana> hi guys, can i get via sftp whole directory not individual files?
[01:11] <Rachel> there's a high quotient of dumb ones in management....
[01:11] <Katherine> On a different note, uptime of my PC is very important to me so I was wondering whether if I installed Linux onto a HDD using a spare PC then moved that HDD to my main PC would the linux still work?
[01:11] <Gale> Rachel: especially in management
=== Clara entered the room.

[01:11] <Diana> get -rR doesn't work;/
[01:11] <Rachel> Jolyn: boto images?
[01:11] <Arlie> Felicia, happens all the time ;)
[01:11] <Lashawna> what does SEO mean in a web dev context?
[01:11] <Gale> Rachel: especially in managment in industrial sector
[01:11] <Rachel> Jolyn: sorry - boot images?
=== Robert entered the room.

[01:12] <Jolyn> I want to install it to Qemu
[01:12] <Jesse> Katherine: why is uptime important to you?
[01:12] <Violette> Jolyn: mount them and cp -r the dirs
[01:12] <Rachel> because its not downtime!
[01:12] <Robert> how come I use ifconfig eth0 -arp, when I do tcpdump I still see ARP who-has <ip> tell <gatewayip>?
[01:12] <Jolyn> They are just directories
=== Francoise entered the room.
[01:12] <Robert> thx
[01:12] <Lashawna> Katherine, do you know of a channel for web devs?

[01:13] <Jolyn> I need to turn them into either a bootable ISO or disk images
[01:13] <Lashawna> it takes too long to load the channel list

[01:15] <Lashawna> maybe it isn't the right time in your life to be thinking about women
[01:15] <Lashawna> that's all I'm going to say
=== Jarrett entered the room.
=== Monty entered the room.
[01:15] <Katherine> anyway, is it ok to do what I asked in my query.

[01:51] <Jeanice> it's not exactly the sort of thing you're guarenteed help with
=== Tien left the room.
=== Sena entered the room.
[01:51] <Jeanice> very experimental stuff i understand... big YMMV stickers all over it
[01:51] <Arlie> ive never used vmware either
[01:51] <Santo> vmware is great
[01:51] <Blondell> vmmv ?
[01:51] <Santo> i've been using it for half a decade now
[01:51] <Arlie> no need for it
=== Tanika entered the room.
=== Sharron entered the room.
[01:52] <Arlie> i dont need to run my text editor or gcc in a virtual environment
[01:52] <Santo> i'm running vmware server on this box and running Photoshop inside WindowsXP. it runs great and is much more stable, IMO
[01:52] <Blondell> Jeanice : YMMV ?
[01:52] <Arlie> no need for windows xp or photoshop either ;)

=== Matt starts doctoring photos with GIMP
[01:53] <Missy> how can i run 32-bit binaries on x86_64 ubuntu os?
[01:53] <Santo> I gave up on GIMP yesterday when I found it didn't have a "layer via cut"
[01:53] <Jeanice> Blondell: your mileage may vary - as in it isn't certain to work all that well, if at all
[01:53] <Margene> layer via cut?
=== Alec left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
[01:53] <Santo> And Layer Via Copy.
[01:53] <Santo> Which are two functions I use very heavily.
[01:53] <Adriana> Santo: iirc it has a paste as new layer (cut/copy and paste)
=== Sheila entered the room.
[01:54] <Rachel> copy from a layer , or by moving to a layer?
=== Cecelia entered the room.
[01:54] <Jeanice> things are usually there, just renamed
[01:54] <Arlie> Santo, all that money to ms and adobe, just because you cant re-train yourself ... what a shame ;)
=== Malcolm entered the room.
[01:54] <Hui> Missy: with difficulty, debian based distros don't support multilib for running 32bit and 64bit apps on the same system.
[01:54] <Santo> Arlie: what money? ;)
[01:54] <Rachel> Arr!
[01:54] <Hui> Missy: any rpm based distro and you'd be fine, on ubuntu you'll be stuck with chroot hacks.
[01:55] <Malcolm> I need to run fetchmail for myself all the time - I can run it as a daemon under my own login and it runs fine, and then survives even if i close my session. How should I script it to start when the machine boots, so I don't have to rememebr to start it manually?
[01:55] <Rachel> Malcolm: put it in rc.local
[01:55] <Rachel> use the deamon invocation
[01:55] <Malcolm> Rachel: run it as root?
=== Rhea left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
=== Matt jumps around
=== Avery left the room (quit: "Leaving").

[01:56] <Meta> so far my general desktop/web server box hasn't been attacked
[01:56] <Meta> w00t
[01:56] <Rachel> Malcolm: sure - as long as the fetchmailrc is set up right, fetchmail takes care of the user ID issues.
[01:56] <Margene> pclos 2007 is out!
[01:57] <Jermaine> hi, I want to print the current date within a bash script like that 05232007 for example for taday, how can I do that?
[01:57] <Jermaine> today*
[01:57] <Meta> use date
[01:57] <Rachel> Malcolm: DAEMON MODE
[01:57] <Rachel> The --daemon <interval> or -d <interval> option runs fetchmail in daemon mode. You must specify a numeric argument which is a polling interval in seconds.
[01:57] <Nicky> try date
=== Lorraine entered the room.

[01:58] <Jetta> how can i install and boot just linux on a mac mini?
